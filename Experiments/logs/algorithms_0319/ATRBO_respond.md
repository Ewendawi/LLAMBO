# Description
Adaptive Trust Region Bayesian Optimization (ATRBO) uses a Gaussian Process (GP) surrogate model with a lower confidence bound (LCB) acquisition function. It dynamically adjusts a trust region around the current best point, focusing exploration within this region while still allowing for occasional exploration outside. The size of the trust region is adapted based on the GP's uncertainty and the optimization progress. Instead of batch evaluation, it uses sequential evaluation with trust region shrinking, which is especially effective when function evaluations are costly. The shrinking factor is also adjusted dynamically during the optimization process to balance exploration and exploitation.

# Justification
The EHBO algorithm, while efficient, showed room for improvement in its exploration-exploitation balance, indicated by its AOCC score. The batch-based approach, while potentially parallelizable, might not always be optimal, especially with limited budgets where sequential refinement can be more effective.

ATRBO addresses these potential issues by:

1.  **Sequential Evaluation with Adaptive Trust Region:** Instead of evaluating multiple points in a batch, ATRBO focuses on evaluating a single point at a time within a trust region. This allows for finer-grained control over exploration and exploitation. The trust region prevents the algorithm from straying too far from promising regions, especially in later stages.

2.  **Dynamic Trust Region Size:** ATRBO dynamically adjusts the trust region size based on the GP's predicted uncertainty (sigma) and the optimization progress. When the uncertainty is high, the trust region expands to encourage exploration. As the optimization progresses and the algorithm converges, the trust region shrinks to facilitate exploitation. This adaptive nature allows the algorithm to focus on promising areas while still maintaining the ability to escape local optima. The shrinking rate `rho` is also dynamically adjusted.

3.  **Lower Confidence Bound (LCB) Acquisition:** The LCB acquisition function (mu - kappa * sigma) is used. The parameter `kappa` is dynamically adjusted to balance exploration and exploitation. A higher `kappa` favors exploration (lower confidence bound), while a lower `kappa` favors exploitation (mean prediction).

4.  **Computational Efficiency:** Optimization of the acquisition function is done via sampling and evaluating, which avoids gradient-based methods.

These changes are designed to improve the balance between exploration and exploitation and to allow the algorithm to adapt more effectively to different function landscapes, hopefully leading to better performance.
