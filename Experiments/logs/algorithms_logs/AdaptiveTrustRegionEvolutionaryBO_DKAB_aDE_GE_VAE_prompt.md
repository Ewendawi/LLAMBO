You are a highly skilled computer scientist in the field of natural computing. Your task is to design novel metaheuristic algorithms to solve black box optimization problems


The optimization algorithm should handle a wide range of tasks, which is evaluated on the BBOB test suite of 24 noiseless functions. Your task is to write the optimization algorithm in Python code. The code should contain an `__init__(self, budget, dim)` function and the function `__call__(self, func)`, which should optimize the black box function `func` using `self.budget` function evaluations.
The func() can only be called as many times as the budget allows, not more. Each of the optimization functions has a search space between -5.0 (lower bound) and 5.0 (upper bound). The dimensionality can be varied.
As an expert of numpy, scipy, scikit-learn, torch, gpytorch, you are allowed to use these libraries. Do not use any other libraries unless they cannot be replaced by the above libraries.  Do not remove the comments from the code.
Name the class based on the characteristics of the algorithm with a template '<characteristics>BO'.

Give an excellent, novel and computationally efficient Bayesian Optimization algorithm to solve this task, give it a concise but comprehensive key-word-style description with the main ideas and justify your decision about the algorithm.

The current population of algorithms already evaluated(name, score, runtime and description):
- AdaptiveTrustRegionEvolutionaryBO_DKAB_aDE_LS: 0.2083, 589.66 seconds, **AdaptiveTrustRegionEvolutionaryBO with Dynamic Kernel, Acquisition Blending, Adaptive DE, and Local Search (ATREBO-DKAB-aDE-LS):** This algorithm builds upon ATREBO-DKAB-aDE by incorporating a more robust local search strategy. The local search is triggered probabilistically based on the trust region adaptation success. The local search uses a gradient-based method (L-BFGS-B) to refine the solution within the trust region. The probability of triggering the local search is increased when the trust region expands, indicating a promising region, and decreased when the trust region shrinks, suggesting a need for broader exploration. The length scale of the GP kernel is also optimized more frequently.


- AdaptiveTrustRegionEvolutionaryBO_DKAB: 0.2038, 576.54 seconds, **AdaptiveTrustRegionEvolutionaryBO with Dynamic Kernel and Acquisition Blending (ATREBO-DKAB):** This algorithm builds upon the original ATREBO by incorporating a dynamic kernel within the Gaussian Process (GP) and blending the Expected Improvement (EI) acquisition function with a variance-based exploration term. The GP kernel dynamically adapts its length scale during the optimization process using an optimization routine, allowing the GP to better capture the function's landscape. Furthermore, the acquisition function is a weighted combination of EI and the GP's predictive variance, with the weights dynamically adjusted based on the optimization progress. This balances exploitation and exploration more effectively. Finally, the differential evolution parameters are adapted using a simplified approach to reduce computational cost.


- AdaptiveTrustRegionEvolutionaryVarianceAwareBO: 0.2029, 482.31 seconds, **Adaptive Trust Region Evolutionary with Dynamic Variance-Aware Acquisition and Adaptive DE (ATREVA-aDE):** This algorithm combines the strengths of ATREBO-DKAB-aDE and ATREVKBO, focusing on robust exploration and exploitation within an adaptive trust region. It uses a dynamic kernel and acquisition blending (Expected Improvement and variance) with adaptive weights. Key improvements include variance-aware exploration, where the exploration weight adapts based on the average GP predictive variance, and adaptive Differential Evolution (DE) with dynamic mutation and crossover rates. This algorithm also incorporates a mechanism to prevent premature trust region shrinkage by considering the magnitude of the predicted improvement. The kernel length scale is optimized using marginal likelihood.


- AdaptiveTrustRegionEvolutionaryBO_DKAB_aDE_GE: 0.2020, 590.94 seconds, **Adaptive Trust Region Evolutionary BO with Dynamic Kernel, Acquisition Blending, Adaptive DE, and Gradient-Enhanced Trust Region Adjustment (ATREBO-DKAB-aDE-GE):** This algorithm combines the strengths of ATREBO-DKAB and ATREBO-DKAB-aDE by incorporating a dynamic kernel, acquisition function blending, and adaptive Differential Evolution (DE). It further enhances trust region adaptation by incorporating gradient information to make the trust region adjustment more informed. Specifically, it estimates the gradient of the surrogate model and uses this information to adjust the trust region radius, promoting expansion along promising directions and contraction in less promising ones. The adaptive DE strategy dynamically adjusts both the mutation and crossover rates based on the observed improvement in the acquisition function values.


- AdaptiveTrustRegionEvolutionaryBO_DKAB_aDE: 0.2009, 605.19 seconds, **AdaptiveTrustRegionEvolutionaryBO with Dynamic Kernel and Acquisition Blending and Adaptive DE (ATREBO-DKAB-aDE):** This algorithm enhances ATREBO-DKAB by incorporating an adaptive Differential Evolution (DE) strategy. Specifically, it dynamically adjusts both the mutation and crossover rates of DE based on the observed improvement in the acquisition function values. This allows DE to better adapt to the local landscape of the acquisition function, improving its ability to find promising candidate solutions within the trust region. Additionally, the trust region adaptation is made more robust by considering the magnitude of the predicted improvement, preventing premature shrinkage in noisy landscapes.


- AdaptiveTrustRegionEvolutionaryLocalSearch_DKBO_PLS: 0.1990, 342.67 seconds, **Adaptive Trust Region Evolutionary Local Search with Dynamic Kernel and Acquisition Blending and Probabilistic Local Search (ATRELS-DKBO-PLS):** This algorithm combines the strengths of ATRELS-DKBO with a more sophisticated probabilistic local search strategy. It retains the dynamic kernel, acquisition function blending, and adaptive trust region framework of ATRELS-DKBO. The local search is enhanced by introducing a probability of performing local search based on the Expected Improvement (EI) value and the observed success rate of previous local searches. This probabilistic approach aims to focus local search efforts in regions where it is most likely to yield improvements, leading to a more efficient and effective optimization process. The algorithm adaptively adjusts the local search radius based on the success rate.


- AdaptiveTrustRegionEvolutionaryBO_DAB: 0.1981, 751.06 seconds, **AdaptiveTrustRegionEvolutionaryBO with Dynamic Acquisition Balancing (ATREBO-DAB):** This algorithm refines the Adaptive Trust Region Evolutionary Bayesian Optimization (ATREBO) by introducing a dynamic balancing factor in the acquisition function between Expected Improvement (EI) and a variance-based exploration term. The balancing factor is adapted based on the optimization progress, specifically the ratio of actual improvement to predicted improvement. This allows the algorithm to dynamically adjust its exploration-exploitation trade-off. Furthermore, the kernel length scale is optimized periodically to better capture the function's landscape.


- AdaptiveTrustRegionEvolutionaryLocalSearch_DKBO: 0.1976, 251.73 seconds, **Adaptive Trust Region Evolutionary Local Search with Dynamic Acquisition Blending and Kernel Tuning Bayesian Optimization (ATRELS-DKBO):** This algorithm integrates the strengths of ATREBO-DKAB and ATRELSBO by incorporating a dynamic kernel, acquisition function blending, and a local search strategy within an adaptive trust region framework. The GP kernel dynamically adapts its length scale. The acquisition function is a weighted combination of Expected Improvement (EI) and GP's predictive variance. A local search strategy refines the search around promising solutions. This algorithm aims to balance global exploration with efficient local exploitation, enhancing overall optimization performance while dynamically adapting the GP kernel for improved landscape capture. We also use a more efficient local search strategy.

## AdaptiveTrustRegionEvolutionaryBO_DKAB_aDE_GE
**Adaptive Trust Region Evolutionary BO with Dynamic Kernel, Acquisition Blending, Adaptive DE, and Gradient-Enhanced Trust Region Adjustment (ATREBO-DKAB-aDE-GE):** This algorithm combines the strengths of ATREBO-DKAB and ATREBO-DKAB-aDE by incorporating a dynamic kernel, acquisition function blending, and adaptive Differential Evolution (DE). It further enhances trust region adaptation by incorporating gradient information to make the trust region adjustment more informed. Specifically, it estimates the gradient of the surrogate model and uses this information to adjust the trust region radius, promoting expansion along promising directions and contraction in less promising ones. The adaptive DE strategy dynamically adjusts both the mutation and crossover rates based on the observed improvement in the acquisition function values.
