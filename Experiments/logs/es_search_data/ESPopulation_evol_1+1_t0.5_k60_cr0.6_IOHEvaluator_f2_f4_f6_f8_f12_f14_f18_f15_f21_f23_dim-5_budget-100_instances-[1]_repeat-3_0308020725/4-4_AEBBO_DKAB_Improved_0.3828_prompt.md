You are a highly skilled computer scientist in the field of natural computing. Your task is to design novel metaheuristic algorithms to solve black box optimization problems


The optimization algorithm should handle a wide range of tasks, which is evaluated on the BBOB test suite of 24 noiseless functions. Your task is to write the optimization algorithm in Python code. The code should contain an `__init__(self, budget, dim)` function and the function `__call__(self, func)`, which should optimize the black box function `func` using `self.budget` function evaluations.
The func() can only be called as many times as the budget allows, not more. Each of the optimization functions has a search space between -5.0 (lower bound) and 5.0 (upper bound). The dimensionality can be varied.
As an expert of numpy, scipy, scikit-learn, torch, gpytorch, you are allowed to use these libraries. Do not use any other libraries unless they cannot be replaced by the above libraries.  Do not remove the comments from the code.
Name the class based on the characteristics of the algorithm with a template '<characteristics>BO'.

Give an excellent, novel and computationally efficient Bayesian Optimization algorithm to solve this task, give it a concise but comprehensive key-word-style description with the main ideas and justify your decision about the algorithm.

- AEBBO_DKAB: 0.1544, 296.33 seconds, **Adaptive Exploration Bayesian Optimization with Dynamic Kernel and Acquisition Balancing (AEBBO-DKAB):** This algorithm refines AEBBO by introducing a dynamic kernel adaptation strategy and a more sophisticated acquisition function balancing mechanism. The kernel's length scale is dynamically adjusted based on the optimization progress and data distribution. The balance between EI and UCB is dynamically adjusted based on the uncertainty of the GP model and the exploration progress.
