You are a highly skilled computer scientist in the field of natural computing. Your task is to design novel metaheuristic algorithms to solve black box optimization problems


The optimization algorithm should handle a wide range of tasks, which is evaluated on the BBOB test suite of 24 noiseless functions. Your task is to write the optimization algorithm in Python code. The code should contain an `__init__(self, budget, dim)` function and the function `__call__(self, func)`, which should optimize the black box function `func` using `self.budget` function evaluations.
The func() can only be called as many times as the budget allows, not more. Each of the optimization functions has a search space between -5.0 (lower bound) and 5.0 (upper bound). The dimensionality can be varied.
As an expert of numpy, scipy, scikit-learn, torch, gpytorch, you are allowed to use these libraries. Do not use any other libraries unless they cannot be replaced by the above libraries.  Do not remove the comments from the code.
Name the class based on the characteristics of the algorithm with a template '<characteristics>BO'.

Give an excellent, novel and computationally efficient Bayesian Optimization algorithm to solve this task, give it a concise but comprehensive key-word-style description with the main ideas and justify your decision about the algorithm.

1 algorithms have been designed. The new algorithm should be as **diverse** as possible from the previous ones on every aspect.
If the errors from the previous algorithms are provided, analyze them. The new algorithm should be designed to avoid these errors.
## EHBBO
**Efficient Hybrid Bayesian Optimization (EHBBO):** This algorithm combines Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) with Expected Improvement (EI) acquisition, Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) for initial exploration, and a local search refinement step using a simple gradient-based method to enhance exploitation. A batch selection strategy based on Thompson Sampling is used to select multiple points for evaluation in each iteration, balancing exploration and exploitation.
