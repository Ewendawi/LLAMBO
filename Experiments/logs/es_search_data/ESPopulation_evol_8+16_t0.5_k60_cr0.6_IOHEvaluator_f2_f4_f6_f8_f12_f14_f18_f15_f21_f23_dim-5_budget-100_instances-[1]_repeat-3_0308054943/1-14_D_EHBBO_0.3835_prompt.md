You are a highly skilled computer scientist in the field of natural computing. Your task is to design novel metaheuristic algorithms to solve black box optimization problems


The optimization algorithm should handle a wide range of tasks, which is evaluated on the BBOB test suite of 24 noiseless functions. Your task is to write the optimization algorithm in Python code. The code should contain an `__init__(self, budget, dim)` function and the function `__call__(self, func)`, which should optimize the black box function `func` using `self.budget` function evaluations.
The func() can only be called as many times as the budget allows, not more. Each of the optimization functions has a search space between -5.0 (lower bound) and 5.0 (upper bound). The dimensionality can be varied.
As an expert of numpy, scipy, scikit-learn, torch, gpytorch, you are allowed to use these libraries. Do not use any other libraries unless they cannot be replaced by the above libraries.  Do not remove the comments from the code.
Name the class based on the characteristics of the algorithm with a template '<characteristics>BO'.

Give an excellent, novel and computationally efficient Bayesian Optimization algorithm to solve this task, give it a concise but comprehensive key-word-style description with the main ideas and justify your decision about the algorithm.

The current population of algorithms already evaluated(name, score, runtime and description):
- DEBO: 0.1705, 63.62 seconds, **DEBO: Diversity Enhanced Bayesian Optimization:** This algorithm focuses on enhancing diversity in Bayesian Optimization using a combination of techniques. It employs a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model with a Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel for surrogate modeling. The acquisition function is a combination of Expected Improvement (EI) and a distance-based diversity term. This diversity term encourages the selection of points that are far away from previously evaluated points. A clustering-based approach is used to identify diverse regions in the search space. The initial exploration is performed using a Sobol sequence to ensure good coverage of the search space.


- ATRBO: 0.1639, 99.40 seconds, **Adaptive Trust Region Bayesian Optimization (ATRBO):** This algorithm uses a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model with a Matérn kernel for surrogate modeling. It employs a trust region approach, adaptively adjusting the size of the trust region based on the agreement between the GPR model and the true objective function. The acquisition function is the Expected Improvement (EI) within the trust region. The initial exploration is performed using Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS). To enhance diversity, a Sobol sequence is used for sampling within the trust region.


- ReBO: 0.1632, 51.69 seconds, **ReBO: Regularized Bayesian Optimization:** This algorithm introduces a regularization term to the acquisition function to prevent overfitting and promote exploration in Bayesian Optimization. It uses a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model with an RBF kernel for surrogate modeling. The acquisition function is a combination of Expected Improvement (EI) and a regularization term based on the L2 norm of the GPR's predicted mean. This regularization encourages the algorithm to explore regions where the model's predictions are less extreme, thus mitigating the risk of prematurely converging to a local optimum. Additionally, an adaptive scaling factor is introduced for the regularization term, which adjusts based on the iteration number, gradually decreasing the regularization as the algorithm progresses. The initial exploration is performed using Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS).


- PaSBO: 0.1614, 55.38 seconds, **PaSBO: Pareto-based Acquisition Steering Bayesian Optimization:** This algorithm introduces a Pareto-based approach to manage multiple acquisition functions in Bayesian Optimization. It uses a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model with an RBF kernel for surrogate modeling. Instead of relying on a single acquisition function, PaSBO maintains a set of acquisition functions, including Expected Improvement (EI), Probability of Improvement (PI), and Upper Confidence Bound (UCB). A Pareto-based selection mechanism is employed to identify a set of non-dominated points based on these multiple acquisition functions. This allows the algorithm to explore the search space more effectively by balancing exploration and exploitation from different perspectives. The initial exploration is performed using a Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS).


- EHBBO: 0.1592, 151.03 seconds, **Efficient Hybrid Bayesian Optimization (EHBBO):** This algorithm combines Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) with Expected Improvement (EI) acquisition, Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) for initial exploration, and a local search refinement step using a simple gradient-based method to enhance exploitation. A batch selection strategy based on Thompson Sampling is used to select multiple points for evaluation in each iteration, balancing exploration and exploitation.


- AGABO: 0.1411, 467.95 seconds, **AGABO: Asynchronous Gradient-Aware Bayesian Optimization:** This algorithm introduces an asynchronous parallelization strategy coupled with gradient information to enhance Bayesian Optimization. It employs a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model with a Matérn kernel for surrogate modeling. The acquisition function is a combination of Expected Improvement (EI) and a gradient-based exploration term. This term leverages the gradient of the GPR's predicted mean to guide exploration towards promising regions with steeper descent. The algorithm uses an asynchronous parallelization strategy, where multiple workers evaluate points concurrently, and the GPR model is updated asynchronously with the newly acquired data. This allows the algorithm to explore the search space more efficiently by mitigating the bottleneck of sequential evaluation. The initial exploration is performed using a Halton sequence to ensure good coverage of the search space. A key aspect is the asynchronous update of the GP model, which requires careful handling to avoid instability.


- CGHBO: 0.0000, 0.00 seconds, **CGHBO: Covariance Guided Hybrid Bayesian Optimization:** This algorithm introduces a novel approach to Bayesian Optimization by incorporating a covariance-based exploration strategy. It uses a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model with a dynamic kernel for surrogate modeling. The acquisition function is a hybrid of Expected Improvement (EI) and a covariance-guided exploration term. This term leverages the covariance matrix of the GPR posterior predictive distribution to identify regions of high uncertainty and potential improvement, promoting exploration in areas where the model is less confident. The algorithm also uses a combination of Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) and a covariance-guided sampling strategy for initial exploration. A gradient-based method is used for local refinement.


- DABO: 0.0000, 0.00 seconds, **DABO: Distribution-Aware Bayesian Optimization:** This algorithm introduces a distribution-aware exploration strategy within Bayesian Optimization. It uses a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model for surrogate modeling. The acquisition function combines Expected Improvement (EI) with a distribution matching term. This term encourages sampling from a distribution that is close to the distribution of promising regions identified by the GPR model. Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) is used to estimate the distribution of promising regions. A modified sampling strategy is employed to sample points from the learned distribution. The initial exploration is performed using Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS).
