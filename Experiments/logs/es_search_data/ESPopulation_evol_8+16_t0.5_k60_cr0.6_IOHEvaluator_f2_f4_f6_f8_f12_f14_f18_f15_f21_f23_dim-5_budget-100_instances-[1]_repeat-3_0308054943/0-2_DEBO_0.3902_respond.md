# Description
**DEBO: Diversity Enhanced Bayesian Optimization:** This algorithm focuses on enhancing diversity in Bayesian Optimization using a combination of techniques. It employs a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model with a Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel for surrogate modeling. The acquisition function is a combination of Expected Improvement (EI) and a distance-based diversity term. This diversity term encourages the selection of points that are far away from previously evaluated points. A clustering-based approach is used to identify diverse regions in the search space. The initial exploration is performed using a Sobol sequence to ensure good coverage of the search space.

# Justification
The DEBO algorithm aims to address the potential for premature convergence in Bayesian Optimization by explicitly promoting diversity in the selection of new points. The key components are justified as follows:

*   **Diversity Term in Acquisition Function:** The addition of a distance-based diversity term to the EI acquisition function encourages the algorithm to explore regions of the search space that are far from previously evaluated points. This helps to prevent the algorithm from getting stuck in local optima.
*   **Clustering-Based Region Identification:** Clustering is used to identify diverse regions in the search space. This allows the algorithm to focus its exploration efforts on the most promising unexplored regions.
*   **Sobol Sequence for Initial Exploration:** Using a Sobol sequence for initial sampling provides a more uniform coverage of the search space compared to Latin Hypercube Sampling, which can help to improve the initial exploration of the algorithm.
*   **RBF Kernel:** The RBF kernel is a good general-purpose kernel that is suitable for a wide range of optimization problems.

This algorithm differs from EHBBO by replacing the local search refinement with a diversity-promoting acquisition function and a clustering-based region identification strategy. It also differs from ATRBO by not using a trust region approach and by using a different acquisition function and initial sampling strategy.
