You are a highly skilled computer scientist in the field of natural computing. Your task is to design novel metaheuristic algorithms to solve black box optimization problems


The optimization algorithm should handle a wide range of tasks, which is evaluated on the BBOB test suite of 24 noiseless functions. Your task is to write the optimization algorithm in Python code. The code should contain an `__init__(self, budget, dim)` function and the function `__call__(self, func)`, which should optimize the black box function `func` using `self.budget` function evaluations.
The func() can only be called as many times as the budget allows, not more. Each of the optimization functions has a search space between -5.0 (lower bound) and 5.0 (upper bound). The dimensionality can be varied.
As an expert of numpy, scipy, scikit-learn, torch, gpytorch, you are allowed to use these libraries. Do not use any other libraries unless they cannot be replaced by the above libraries.  Do not remove the comments from the code.
Name the class based on the characteristics of the algorithm with a template '<characteristics>BO'.

Give an excellent, novel and computationally efficient Bayesian Optimization algorithm to solve this task, give it a concise but comprehensive key-word-style description with the main ideas and justify your decision about the algorithm.

The current population of algorithms already evaluated(name, score, runtime and description):
- ATRBO: 0.0905, 338.70 seconds, Adaptive Trust Region Bayesian Optimization (ATRBO) uses a Gaussian Process (GP) surrogate model with a lower confidence bound (LCB) acquisition function. It dynamically adjusts a trust region around the current best point, focusing exploration within this region while still allowing for occasional exploration outside. The size of the trust region is adapted based on the GP's uncertainty and the optimization progress. Instead of batch evaluation, it uses sequential evaluation with trust region shrinking, which is especially effective when function evaluations are costly. The shrinking factor is also adjusted dynamically during the optimization process to balance exploration and exploitation.


- EHBO: 0.0479, 85.21 seconds, Efficient Hybrid Bayesian Optimization (EHBO) leverages a Gaussian Process (GP) surrogate model with Expected Improvement (EI) acquisition. For computational efficiency, it employs a batch-oriented approach using a combination of quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) sampling (Sobol sequence) for exploration and gradient-based optimization (L-BFGS-B) of the acquisition function for exploitation. A crucial component is the dynamic adaptation of the batch size based on remaining budget and the dimension of the search space. This balances exploration and exploitation throughout the optimization process. Specifically, the batch size starts relatively large to promote initial exploration, and then it decreases as the remaining budget dwindles, to enable more focused exploitation near the end of the budget. This also allows for efficient parallelization, if available.


- DEHBBO: 0.0464, 45.95 seconds, DEHBBO: Diversity Enhanced Hybrid Bayesian Black Optimization. This algorithm combines aspects of both EHBO and ATRBO, while introducing a diversity-enhancing component to mitigate premature convergence. It uses a Gaussian Process with Expected Improvement acquisition, similar to EHBO, but incorporates ideas from ATRBO through adaptive sampling. The core innovation lies in a dynamic diversity maintenance strategy. After a few iterations, the algorithm begins to maintain a "Hall of Fame" of diverse solutions based on the euclidean distance in the decision space. The acquisition function is modified to penalize points close to existing members in the hall of fame, promoting exploration of less-visited regions. The size of the Hall of Fame is dynamically adjusted. The batch selection uses a combination of L-BFGS-B, like EHBO, and random sampling around the best location.


- SPBO: 0.0000, 0.00 seconds, Stochastic Patch Bayesian Optimization (SPBO) uses a combination of a Gaussian Process (GP) surrogate model and a Thompson Sampling acquisition function. The key innovation is the use of "stochastic patches" which are randomly sampled subsets of the input dimensions. The GP is trained on the full dataset, but the acquisition function is evaluated by randomly selecting a patch of dimensions and performing Thompson sampling on that patch. This introduces stochasticity and encourages exploration in different subspaces, especially useful in high-dimensional problems where it's computationally expensive to explore the entire space exhaustively. A crucial component is the dynamic adaptation of the patch size based on remaining budget and the dimension of the search space, ensuring that exploration and exploitation are balanced.
