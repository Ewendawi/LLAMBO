You are a highly skilled computer scientist in the field of natural computing. Your task is to design novel metaheuristic algorithms to solve black box optimization problems


The optimization algorithm should handle a wide range of tasks, which is evaluated on the BBOB test suite of 24 noiseless functions. Your task is to write the optimization algorithm in Python code. The code should contain an `__init__(self, budget, dim)` function and the function `__call__(self, func)`, which should optimize the black box function `func` using `self.budget` function evaluations.
The func() can only be called as many times as the budget allows, not more. Each of the optimization functions has a search space between -5.0 (lower bound) and 5.0 (upper bound). The dimensionality can be varied.
As an expert of numpy, scipy, scikit-learn, torch, gpytorch, you are allowed to use these libraries. Do not use any other libraries unless they cannot be replaced by the above libraries.  Do not remove the comments from the code.
Name the class based on the characteristics of the algorithm with a template '<characteristics>BO'.

Give an excellent, novel and computationally efficient Bayesian Optimization algorithm to solve this task, give it a concise but comprehensive key-word-style description with the main ideas and justify your decision about the algorithm.

The current population of algorithms already evaluated(name, score, runtime and description):
- BAEHBBO: 0.1355, 40.47 seconds, **Budget-Aware Efficient Hybrid Bayesian Optimization (BA-EHBBO):** This algorithm refines the EHBBO by incorporating a budget-aware local search strategy. Instead of directly evaluating the objective function during the Nelder-Mead local search, it leverages the Gaussian Process surrogate model to estimate the function values. This significantly reduces the number of actual function evaluations, preventing the "OverBudgetException". The algorithm also includes a check to ensure the local search doesn't exceed the remaining budget.
