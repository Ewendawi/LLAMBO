You are a highly skilled computer scientist in the field of natural computing. Your task is to design novel metaheuristic algorithms to solve black box optimization problems


The optimization algorithm should handle a wide range of tasks, which is evaluated on the BBOB test suite of 24 noiseless functions. Your task is to write the optimization algorithm in Python code. The code should contain an `__init__(self, budget, dim)` function and the function `__call__(self, func)`, which should optimize the black box function `func` using `self.budget` function evaluations.
The func() can only be called as many times as the budget allows, not more. Each of the optimization functions has a search space between -5.0 (lower bound) and 5.0 (upper bound). The dimensionality can be varied.
As an expert of numpy, scipy, scikit-learn, torch, gpytorch, you are allowed to use these libraries. Do not use any other libraries unless they cannot be replaced by the above libraries.  Do not remove the comments from the code.
Name the class based on the characteristics of the algorithm with a template '<characteristics>BO'.

Give an excellent, novel and computationally efficient Bayesian Optimization algorithm to solve this task, give it a concise but comprehensive key-word-style description with the main ideas and justify your decision about the algorithm.

The current population of algorithms already evaluated(name, score, runtime and description):
- EHBBO: 0.1605, 56.90 seconds, **Efficient Hybrid Bayesian Optimization (EHBBO):** This algorithm combines an initial space-filling design using Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS), a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) surrogate model, and a hybrid acquisition function that balances exploration and exploitation. The acquisition function combines Expected Improvement (EI) and a distance-based exploration term. A simple but effective batch selection strategy is used to select multiple points for evaluation in each iteration.


- SETSBO: 0.1544, 165.78 seconds, **Surrogate Ensemble with Thompson Sampling and Local Search (SETSBO):** This algorithm leverages an ensemble of surrogate models (Gaussian Process Regression with different kernels) to improve the robustness and accuracy of the Bayesian optimization process. It uses Thompson Sampling for acquisition, which naturally balances exploration and exploitation. Furthermore, it integrates a local search strategy (L-BFGS-B) to refine the search around promising regions identified by Thompson Sampling. The ensemble of surrogates provides a more reliable estimate of the function landscape, while Thompson Sampling offers a computationally efficient way to select the next points. Local search further enhances the exploitation of promising regions.


- DensiTreeBO: 0.1502, 21.60 seconds, **DensiTreeBO (DTBO):** This algorithm introduces a novel approach to Bayesian Optimization by employing a density-based clustering technique to identify promising regions in the search space. Instead of relying solely on the Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model and acquisition function to select the next points, DTBO uses a density estimation method (Kernel Density Estimation - KDE) on the evaluated points to locate high-density clusters. These clusters are then used to guide the selection of new points, promoting exploration within promising areas and exploitation of the best-performing clusters. The acquisition function is used to refine the point selection within the clusters. This approach aims to improve the balance between exploration and exploitation, especially in multimodal or complex search spaces.


- BONGIBO: 0.1464, 37.41 seconds, **Bayesian Optimization with Noisy Handling and Gradient-based Improvement (BONGIBO):** This algorithm addresses the limitations of standard BO by incorporating a mechanism to handle potential noise in the function evaluations and leveraging gradient information to refine the search. It uses a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) surrogate model with noise variance estimation and a modified Expected Improvement (EI) acquisition function. The key innovation is the integration of gradient-based local search to improve the exploitation of promising regions, which is particularly useful when the function landscape has local optima or is noisy. The initial points are sampled using a Sobol sequence for better space coverage than LHS.


- ATRBO: 0.1377, 209.56 seconds, **Adaptive Trust Region Bayesian Optimization (ATRBO):** This algorithm uses a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) surrogate model and an Expected Improvement (EI) acquisition function within an adaptive trust region framework. The trust region size is adjusted based on the agreement between the GPR predictions and the actual function evaluations. A shrinking trust region encourages exploitation, while an expanding trust region promotes exploration. The initial points are sampled using Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS).


- HyperImprovBO: 0.0000, 0.00 seconds, **HyperImprovBO (HIBO):** This algorithm introduces a novel hyperparameter optimization strategy within the Bayesian Optimization framework. It dynamically adjusts the acquisition function's exploration-exploitation trade-off and the Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) kernel parameters during the optimization process. HIBO employs a separate meta-optimization loop to tune these hyperparameters based on the observed performance of the BO algorithm. This adaptive hyperparameter tuning allows the algorithm to tailor its search strategy to the specific characteristics of the objective function, potentially leading to improved convergence and performance. The initial points are sampled using a Halton sequence.


- VAEBO: 0.0000, 0.00 seconds, **VariationalAutoencoderBO (VAEBO):** This algorithm uses a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to learn a latent representation of the search space. The VAE is trained on the evaluated points, and the acquisition function is evaluated in the latent space. This allows the algorithm to explore the search space more efficiently, especially in high-dimensional problems or problems with complex dependencies. The algorithm uses Expected Improvement (EI) as the acquisition function. The initial points are sampled using Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS).

The error in HyperImprovBO was due to the temporary BO object not having a model fitted. This is addressed in VAEBO by ensuring the VAE is trained before being used.


- DKLCBBO: 0.0000, 0.00 seconds, **Bayesian Optimization with Deep Kernel Learning and Contextual Bandit (DKLCBBO):** This algorithm combines Deep Kernel Learning (DKL) to learn a task-specific kernel for the Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model and a Contextual Bandit approach to dynamically balance exploration and exploitation. DKL uses a neural network to map the input space to a feature space where a simple RBF kernel can effectively model the function's covariance structure. The Contextual Bandit component treats each iteration of BO as a bandit problem, where the "context" is the current state of the optimization (e.g., evaluated points, GPR predictions) and the "arms" are candidate points to evaluate. A bandit policy (e.g., Thompson Sampling) is used to select the next point, adapting the exploration-exploitation trade-off based on the observed rewards (function values). This approach aims to improve the adaptability and efficiency of BO, especially in complex and high-dimensional search spaces.

A simple but effective batch selection strategy is used to select multiple points for evaluation in each iteration.
