# Description
**Adaptive Exploration-Exploitation EHBBO (AEEHBBO):** This algorithm refines the EHBBO algorithm by introducing an adaptive exploration-exploitation balance in the acquisition function and using a more efficient point selection strategy. The exploration weight in the hybrid acquisition function is dynamically adjusted based on the optimization progress. Specifically, the exploration weight decreases as the number of evaluations increases, shifting the focus from exploration to exploitation. Additionally, the point selection strategy is refined by using a combination of random sampling and local search around the best point found so far.

# Justification
The key improvements are:

1.  **Adaptive Exploration Weight:** Instead of a fixed exploration weight (0.1), the exploration weight is made adaptive. It starts with a higher value to encourage exploration in the initial stages and gradually decreases to promote exploitation as the optimization progresses. This is achieved by decreasing the exploration weight linearly with the number of evaluations. A lower bound is set to prevent premature convergence.
2.  **Enhanced Point Selection:** The point selection strategy is improved by combining random sampling with local search. The algorithm generates candidate points using Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) and also adds points generated by perturbing the best-seen solution. This allows the algorithm to explore the search space while also exploiting the most promising regions.
3.  **Computational Efficiency:** The adaptive exploration and enhanced point selection strategies are designed to improve the algorithm's performance without significantly increasing the computational cost.
