# Description
**Hybrid Density-Enhanced Bayesian Optimization (HyDEBO):** This algorithm synergistically combines the strengths of EHBBO and DensiTreeBO. It employs a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model with a hybrid acquisition function (Expected Improvement + Distance-based Exploration) from EHBBO for balancing exploration and exploitation. It integrates a Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) from DensiTreeBO to focus the search on high-density regions of promising solutions. Furthermore, it adaptively adjusts the KDE bandwidth based on the dimensionality of the search space. The initial sampling is performed using Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) to ensure good space coverage.

# Justification
The key components are justified as follows:
*   **Hybrid Acquisition Function (EHBBO):** The Expected Improvement (EI) component promotes exploitation of promising regions, while the distance-based exploration term encourages exploration of less-sampled areas. This combination provides a good balance between exploration and exploitation.
*   **Kernel Density Estimation (DensiTreeBO):** KDE helps to identify and focus the search on high-density regions of promising solutions. This is particularly useful in multimodal or complex search spaces.
*   **Adaptive KDE Bandwidth:** The KDE bandwidth is adaptively adjusted based on the dimensionality of the search space. This helps to ensure that the KDE is appropriately tuned for the specific problem being solved. The bandwidth is inversely proportional to the dimension, which means that higher dimensional problems are given smaller bandwidths.
*   **Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS):** LHS provides good space coverage for the initial sampling, which helps to ensure that the algorithm explores the search space effectively.

This combination of techniques aims to improve the efficiency and robustness of the Bayesian optimization process, leading to better performance on a wide range of black-box optimization problems.
