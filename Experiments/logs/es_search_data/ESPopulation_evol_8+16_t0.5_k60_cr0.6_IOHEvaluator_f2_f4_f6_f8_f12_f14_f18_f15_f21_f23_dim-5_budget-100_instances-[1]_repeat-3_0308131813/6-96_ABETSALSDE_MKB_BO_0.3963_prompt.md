You are a highly skilled computer scientist in the field of natural computing. Your task is to design novel metaheuristic algorithms to solve black box optimization problems


The optimization algorithm should handle a wide range of tasks, which is evaluated on the BBOB test suite of 24 noiseless functions. Your task is to write the optimization algorithm in Python code. The code should contain an `__init__(self, budget, dim)` function and the function `__call__(self, func)`, which should optimize the black box function `func` using `self.budget` function evaluations.
The func() can only be called as many times as the budget allows, not more. Each of the optimization functions has a search space between -5.0 (lower bound) and 5.0 (upper bound). The dimensionality can be varied.
As an expert of numpy, scipy, scikit-learn, torch, gpytorch, you are allowed to use these libraries. Do not use any other libraries unless they cannot be replaced by the above libraries.  Do not remove the comments from the code.
Name the class based on the characteristics of the algorithm with a template '<characteristics>BO'.

Give an excellent, novel and computationally efficient Bayesian Optimization algorithm to solve this task, give it a concise but comprehensive key-word-style description with the main ideas and justify your decision about the algorithm.

The current population of algorithms already evaluated(name, score, runtime and description):
- ABETSALSDEBO: 0.1804, 582.71 seconds, **Adaptive Batch Ensemble with Thompson Sampling, Density-Aware Exploration, and Uncertainty-Aware Local Search Bayesian Optimization (ABETSALSDEBO):** This algorithm combines the strengths of ABDAHBO and AEHTSALSBO. It uses an adaptive ensemble of Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) models, similar to AEHTSALSBO, dynamically adjusting the ensemble size based on optimization progress. It employs Thompson Sampling for efficient acquisition within the ensemble. The batch size is adaptively adjusted based on the average uncertainty of the GPR predictions, as in ABDAHBO. Furthermore, it incorporates an uncertainty-aware local search, using the variance predictions from the GPR models to guide the local search iterations and step size, similar to AEHTSALSBO. It also includes a Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to focus the search on high-density regions of promising solutions, with the bandwidth dynamically adjusted based on the local density of evaluated points, as in ABDAHBO. The acquisition function is a hybrid of Expected Improvement (EI), a distance-based exploration term, and a KDE-based exploration term. The exploration weight decay is also adjusted based on the batch size, ensuring a more robust exploration-exploitation trade-off.


- AETSALSARBO: 0.1799, 466.90 seconds, **Adaptive Ensemble with Thompson Sampling, Dynamic Exploration, and Adaptive Local Search Radius Bayesian Optimization (AETSALSARBO):** This algorithm combines the strengths of ABETSALSDEBO and AHBBO_ABSLS_V2, focusing on adaptive exploration-exploitation and efficient local search within an ensemble framework. It uses an ensemble of Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) models with varying length scales to capture different aspects of the function landscape. Thompson Sampling is employed for efficient acquisition, balancing exploration and exploitation within the ensemble. An adaptive local search, guided by the uncertainty estimates from the GPR models, refines the solutions. The exploration weight in the hybrid acquisition function is dynamically adjusted based on both the optimization progress and the GPR model uncertainty, allowing for a robust and efficient exploration-exploitation trade-off. It also incorporates a dynamic ensemble size adjustment based on the optimization progress. Furthermore, the local search radius is adaptively adjusted based on the optimization progress and the GPR model's uncertainty.


- ABETSALSDE_KBA_BO: 0.1796, 621.55 seconds, **Adaptive Batch Ensemble with Thompson Sampling, Density-Aware Exploration, Uncertainty-Aware Local Search, and Kernel Bandwidth Adaptation Bayesian Optimization (ABETSALSDE-KBA-BO):** This algorithm builds upon ABETSALSDEBO by incorporating an adaptive kernel bandwidth strategy for the Kernel Density Estimation (KDE). It maintains an ensemble of Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) models, uses Thompson Sampling for acquisition, employs density-aware exploration via KDE, and performs uncertainty-aware local search. The key enhancement is the dynamic adjustment of the KDE bandwidth based not only on the nearest neighbor distances but also on the optimization progress. This allows for a more refined density estimation, particularly in the later stages of optimization, leading to improved exploration and exploitation. The exploration weight is also dynamically adjusted based on the optimization progress and the GPR model uncertainty.


- AETSALS_KDEBO: 0.1766, 525.90 seconds, **Adaptive Ensemble with Thompson Sampling, Uncertainty-Aware Local Search, and Kernel Density Estimation (AETSALS-KDEBO):** This algorithm combines the strengths of ABETSALSBO and AEHTSALSBO while incorporating Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to improve exploration and exploitation. It adaptively manages an ensemble of Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) models, dynamically adjusting the ensemble size based on optimization progress. Thompson Sampling is used for efficient acquisition within the ensemble. The batch size is adaptively adjusted based on the average uncertainty of the GPR predictions. An uncertainty-aware local search, using the variance predictions from the GPR models, guides the local search iterations and step size. The acquisition function is a hybrid of Expected Improvement (EI), a distance-based exploration term, and a KDE-based exploration term. The KDE bandwidth is dynamically adjusted based on the local density of evaluated points.


- ABDAHLSBO: 0.1757, 303.63 seconds, **Adaptive Batch-Size Density-Aware Hybrid Bayesian Optimization with Local Search (ABDAHLSBO):** This algorithm combines the strengths of ABDAHBO and AHBBO_ABSLS, incorporating adaptive batch size based on GPR uncertainty, density-aware exploration using KDE, and local search around the best solution found so far. It dynamically adjusts the KDE bandwidth and exploration weight. The adaptive batch size helps to balance exploration and exploitation, while the KDE focuses the search on promising regions. The local search refines the solutions found by the global search.


- ABETSALS_MBO: 0.1739, 529.69 seconds, **Adaptive Batch Ensemble with Thompson Sampling, Dynamic Exploration, and Adaptive Local Search with Momentum (ABETSALS-MBO):** This algorithm builds upon ABETSALSDEBO by incorporating momentum into the local search and refining the exploration strategy. It adaptively manages an ensemble of Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) models, using Thompson Sampling for acquisition. The batch size is dynamically adjusted based on GPR uncertainty. It employs an adaptive local search with momentum, guided by GPR variance predictions, to refine solutions. The exploration strategy combines distance-based exploration with a dynamic exploration weight that considers both the optimization progress and the GPR uncertainty. The local search step size is also dynamically adjusted.


- AETSALS_KDEBO_V2: 0.1731, 568.23 seconds, **AETSALS_KDEBO_V2: Adaptive Ensemble with Thompson Sampling, Uncertainty-Aware Local Search, Kernel Density Estimation, and Improved Exploration-Exploitation Balance.** This algorithm builds upon AETSALS_KDEBO by refining the exploration-exploitation balance through dynamic adjustment of the exploration weight based on optimization progress and GPR uncertainty, and by incorporating a more sophisticated KDE bandwidth adaptation strategy. Additionally, the local search is enhanced with a momentum term to escape local optima more effectively.


- AETSDALSBO: 0.1727, 751.13 seconds, **Adaptive Ensemble with Thompson Sampling, Dynamic Exploration, and Adaptive Local Search with Momentum (AETSDALSBO):** This algorithm builds upon ABETSALSDEBO and AETSALSDEBO, incorporating adaptive momentum in the local search and refining the dynamic exploration strategy. It uses an adaptive ensemble of Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) models with varying length scales and Thompson Sampling for efficient acquisition. It dynamically adjusts the batch size and exploration weight based on model uncertainty.

The algorithm AETSALS_KDEBO_V2 got an average Area over the convergence curve (AOCC, 1.0 is the best) score of 0.1731 with standard deviation 0.1160.

took 568.23 seconds to run.

Combine the selected solutions to create a new solution. Then refine the strategy of the new solution to improve it. If the errors from the previous algorithms are provided, analyze them. The new algorithm should be designed to avoid these errors.
