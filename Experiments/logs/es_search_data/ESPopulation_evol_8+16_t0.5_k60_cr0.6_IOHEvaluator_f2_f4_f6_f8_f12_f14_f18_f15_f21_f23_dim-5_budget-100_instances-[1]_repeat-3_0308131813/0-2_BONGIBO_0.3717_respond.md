# Description
**Bayesian Optimization with Noisy Handling and Gradient-based Improvement (BONGIBO):** This algorithm addresses the limitations of standard BO by incorporating a mechanism to handle potential noise in the function evaluations and leveraging gradient information to refine the search. It uses a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) surrogate model with noise variance estimation and a modified Expected Improvement (EI) acquisition function. The key innovation is the integration of gradient-based local search to improve the exploitation of promising regions, which is particularly useful when the function landscape has local optima or is noisy. The initial points are sampled using a Sobol sequence for better space coverage than LHS.

# Justification
1.  **Noise Handling:** The BBOB suite is noiseless, but adding a noise handling mechanism makes the algorithm more robust and generalizable to real-world problems. The GPR model is adapted to estimate the noise variance from the data, which is then incorporated into the EI calculation.
2.  **Gradient-based Improvement:** While the BBOB functions are not explicitly noisy, the surrogate model introduces approximation errors that can be viewed as a form of noise. The gradient-based local search helps to refine the search around promising regions identified by the acquisition function, mitigating the impact of these errors and improving convergence.
3.  **Sobol Sequence:** Using a Sobol sequence for initial sampling provides better space-filling properties compared to LHS, especially in higher dimensions. This helps to improve the initial exploration of the search space.
4.  **Acquisition Function Modification:** The EI acquisition function is modified to account for the estimated noise variance and to encourage exploration in regions with high uncertainty.
5.  **Computational Efficiency:** The gradient-based local search is performed only on a subset of the points selected by the acquisition function, balancing the need for exploitation with the computational cost.
6.  **Diversity from Previous Algorithms:** This algorithm differs from EHBBO and ATRBO by incorporating noise handling, gradient-based local search, and a Sobol sequence for initial sampling. It also uses a different acquisition function modification to balance exploration and exploitation. EHBBO uses a distance-based exploration term in the acquisition function, while BONGIBO uses a noise-aware EI and gradient-based improvement. ATRBO uses a trust region framework, which is not present in BONGIBO.
