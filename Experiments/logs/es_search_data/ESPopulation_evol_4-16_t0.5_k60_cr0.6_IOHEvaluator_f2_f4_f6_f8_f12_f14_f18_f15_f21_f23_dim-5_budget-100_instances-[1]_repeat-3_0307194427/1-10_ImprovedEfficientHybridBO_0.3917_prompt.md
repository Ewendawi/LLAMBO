You are a highly skilled computer scientist in the field of natural computing. Your task is to design novel metaheuristic algorithms to solve black box optimization problems


The optimization algorithm should handle a wide range of tasks, which is evaluated on the BBOB test suite of 24 noiseless functions. Your task is to write the optimization algorithm in Python code. The code should contain an `__init__(self, budget, dim)` function and the function `__call__(self, func)`, which should optimize the black box function `func` using `self.budget` function evaluations.
The func() can only be called as many times as the budget allows, not more. Each of the optimization functions has a search space between -5.0 (lower bound) and 5.0 (upper bound). The dimensionality can be varied.
As an expert of numpy, scipy, scikit-learn, torch, gpytorch, you are allowed to use these libraries. Do not use any other libraries unless they cannot be replaced by the above libraries.  Do not remove the comments from the code.
Name the class based on the characteristics of the algorithm with a template '<characteristics>BO'.

Give an excellent, novel and computationally efficient Bayesian Optimization algorithm to solve this task, give it a concise but comprehensive key-word-style description with the main ideas and justify your decision about the algorithm.

The current population of algorithms already evaluated(name, score, runtime and description):
- AdaptiveTrustRegionBO: 0.1833, 486.80 seconds, **AdaptiveTrustRegionBO (ATBO)**: This algorithm uses a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model with a dynamically adjusted trust region to balance exploration and exploitation. It starts with a global search and progressively narrows the search space around promising regions. The trust region size is adapted based on the GPR's uncertainty and the improvement observed in previous iterations. The acquisition function is based on Expected Improvement (EI).  To enhance diversity, a Sobol sequence is used for sampling within the trust region, and a mechanism is included to occasionally expand the trust region if progress stagnates.


- EfficientHybridBO: 0.1566, 4.07 seconds, **Efficient Hybrid Bayesian Optimization (EHBBO)**: This algorithm combines Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) with Expected Improvement (EI) for exploration-exploitation balance. It employs a Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) for initial exploration and a batch selection strategy based on EI and distance metric to ensure diversity in selected points. To improve the computational efficiency, it uses a simplified GPR model with a fixed kernel and optimizes only the kernel amplitude.


- BayesianEnsembleBO: 0.1564, 140.43 seconds, **BayesianEnsembleBO (BEBO)**: This algorithm employs an ensemble of Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) models with different kernels to capture diverse aspects of the objective function. It uses Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) for initial exploration. The acquisition function is based on the ensemble's prediction, considering both the mean and variance across the ensemble members. The next points are selected by optimizing the acquisition function using a simple evolutionary strategy. The ensemble is updated periodically to reduce computational overhead. This approach aims to improve robustness and exploration compared to a single GP model.

The error of `BayesianQuasiNewtonBO` was an `OverBudgetException`. This happened because the `minimize` function was calling the `func` directly, exceeding the budget. The new algorithm will not call `func` in the `_select_next_points` to avoid this error.


- BayesianQuasiNewtonBO: 0.0000, 0.00 seconds, **BayesianQuasiNewtonBO (BQNB)**: This algorithm combines Bayesian Optimization with a Quasi-Newton method (specifically, BFGS) for local refinement. It uses a Gaussian Process (GP) to model the objective function and Expected Improvement (EI) as the acquisition function. After selecting a promising point via EI, it performs a local optimization step using BFGS, initialized at the EI-selected point, to refine the solution. This aims to leverage the global exploration of BO with the efficient local convergence of gradient-based methods. To mitigate the computational cost associated with repeated GP fitting, the GP is updated only periodically. Initial points are sampled using Latin Hypercube Sampling.




The selected solution to update is:
**Efficient Hybrid Bayesian Optimization (EHBBO)**: This algorithm combines Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) with Expected Improvement (EI) for exploration-exploitation balance. It employs a Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) for initial exploration and a batch selection strategy based on EI and distance metric to ensure diversity in selected points. To improve the computational efficiency, it uses a simplified GPR model with a fixed kernel and optimizes only the kernel amplitude.
