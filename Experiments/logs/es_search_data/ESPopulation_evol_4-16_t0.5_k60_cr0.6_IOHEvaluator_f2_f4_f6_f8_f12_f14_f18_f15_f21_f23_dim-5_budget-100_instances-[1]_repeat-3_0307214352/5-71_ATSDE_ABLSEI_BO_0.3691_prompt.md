You are a highly skilled computer scientist in the field of natural computing. Your task is to design novel metaheuristic algorithms to solve black box optimization problems


The optimization algorithm should handle a wide range of tasks, which is evaluated on the BBOB test suite of 24 noiseless functions. Your task is to write the optimization algorithm in Python code. The code should contain an `__init__(self, budget, dim)` function and the function `__call__(self, func)`, which should optimize the black box function `func` using `self.budget` function evaluations.
The func() can only be called as many times as the budget allows, not more. Each of the optimization functions has a search space between -5.0 (lower bound) and 5.0 (upper bound). The dimensionality can be varied.
As an expert of numpy, scipy, scikit-learn, torch, gpytorch, you are allowed to use these libraries. Do not use any other libraries unless they cannot be replaced by the above libraries.  Do not remove the comments from the code.
Name the class based on the characteristics of the algorithm with a template '<characteristics>BO'.

Give an excellent, novel and computationally efficient Bayesian Optimization algorithm to solve this task, give it a concise but comprehensive key-word-style description with the main ideas and justify your decision about the algorithm.

The current population of algorithms already evaluated(name, score, runtime and description):
- ATSDE_APLS_BO: 0.1682, 843.95 seconds, **ATSDE_APLS_BO: Adaptive Temperature and Success-Rate based DE-BO with Adaptive Probabilistic Local Search.** This algorithm combines the adaptive temperature control from ATSDE_LS_BO with the adaptive probabilistic local search and adaptive population size from ASRDE_PLS_BO_v2. The key improvement is the synergistic combination of exploration-exploitation balancing via temperature annealing, success-rate based parameter adaptation, adaptive population size, and a more refined probabilistic local search that considers both GP uncertainty and EI. The local search probability is dynamically adjusted based on GP uncertainty and Expected Improvement (EI).


- ATSDE_ExTempLS_BO: 0.1679, 1728.45 seconds, **ATSDE_ExTempLS_BO: Adaptive Temperature and Success-Rate based DE-BO with Exploration Temperature and Enhanced Local Search Bayesian Optimization.** This algorithm synergistically combines the strengths of ATSDE_LS_BO and ASRDE_ExTempLS_BO. It incorporates adaptive temperature control, adaptive success-rate based F and CR adaptation for Differential Evolution (DE), and an enhanced local search strategy. The local search range is dynamically adjusted based on the GP's uncertainty, and a more robust local search initialization is used. Additionally, the algorithm employs a success rate-based adaptation for F and CR, making it more responsive to changes in the optimization landscape. The core idea is to leverage both global exploration (DE with temperature annealing) and local refinement (enhanced local search) in a balanced manner, guided by the Gaussian Process (GP) surrogate model.


- ATSDE_ABLS_LCB_BO: 0.1672, 772.18 seconds, **ATSDE_ABLS_LCB_BO: Adaptive Temperature and Success-Rate based DE-BO with Adaptive Batch size, Local Search and LCB acquisition function.** This algorithm combines the adaptive temperature and success-rate based Differential Evolution (DE) from ATSDE_LS_BO with the adaptive batch size and LCB acquisition function from DE_ABLS_LCB_BO. This aims to balance exploration and exploitation more effectively. The local search is retained, and its probability is dynamically adjusted based on the GP's uncertainty. The algorithm also incorporates a mechanism to adapt the batch size based on the GP's uncertainty to improve sampling efficiency.


- ASRDE_ExTempLS_BO_v2: 0.1668, 1725.95 seconds, **ASRDE_ExTempLS_BO_v2: Adaptive Success-Rate DE with Exploration Temperature, Enhanced Local Search, and Adaptive F/CR Step Size Bayesian Optimization.** This algorithm refines ASRDE_ExTempLS_BO by introducing an adaptive step size for F and CR adaptation. Instead of a fixed learning rate, the step size is adjusted based on the recent success of the DE iterations. This allows for finer adjustments of F and CR when the algorithm is converging well, and larger adjustments when it is stuck. Additionally, a momentum term is added to the F and CR adaptation to smooth the updates. Also, the local search initialization is improved by using a combination of Latin Hypercube sampling and the best point found so far.




The selected solution to update is:
**ATSDE_ABLS_LCB_BO: Adaptive Temperature and Success-Rate based DE-BO with Adaptive Batch size, Local Search and LCB acquisition function.** This algorithm combines the adaptive temperature and success-rate based Differential Evolution (DE) from ATSDE_LS_BO with the adaptive batch size and LCB acquisition function from DE_ABLS_LCB_BO. This aims to balance exploration and exploitation more effectively. The local search is retained, and its probability is dynamically adjusted based on the GP's uncertainty. The algorithm also incorporates a mechanism to adapt the batch size based on the GP's uncertainty to improve sampling efficiency.
