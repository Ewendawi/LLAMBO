You are a highly skilled computer scientist in the field of natural computing. Your task is to design novel metaheuristic algorithms to solve black box optimization problems


The optimization algorithm should handle a wide range of tasks, which is evaluated on the BBOB test suite of 24 noiseless functions. Your task is to write the optimization algorithm in Python code. The code should contain an `__init__(self, budget, dim)` function and the function `__call__(self, func)`, which should optimize the black box function `func` using `self.budget` function evaluations.
The func() can only be called as many times as the budget allows, not more. Each of the optimization functions has a search space between -5.0 (lower bound) and 5.0 (upper bound). The dimensionality can be varied.
As an expert of numpy, scipy, scikit-learn, torch, gpytorch, you are allowed to use these libraries. Do not use any other libraries unless they cannot be replaced by the above libraries.  Do not remove the comments from the code.
Name the class based on the characteristics of the algorithm with a template '<characteristics>BO'.

Give an excellent, novel and computationally efficient Bayesian Optimization algorithm to solve this task, give it a concise but comprehensive key-word-style description with the main ideas and justify your decision about the algorithm.

The current population of algorithms already evaluated(name, score, runtime and description):
- Adaptive_DE_BO: 0.1673, 1512.20 seconds, DE-BO with Adaptive Mutation and Crossover: This algorithm builds upon the existing DE-BO framework by introducing adaptive mutation and crossover rates within the Differential Evolution (DE) optimization of the Expected Improvement (EI) acquisition function. The mutation factor (F) and crossover rate (CR) are no longer fixed but are dynamically adjusted based on the success of previous DE iterations. Specifically, if a trial vector results in an improvement in the EI value compared to the current population member, the F and CR values used to generate that trial vector are slightly increased. Conversely, if no improvement is observed, the F and CR values are decreased. This adaptive scheme allows DE to more effectively explore and exploit the search space of the acquisition function, leading to better candidate solutions for evaluation. Additionally, the population size for DE is made dependent on the dimension of the problem.


- DE_BO_Adaptive: 0.1659, 1079.95 seconds, DE_BO_Adaptive: Differential Evolution Bayesian Optimization with adaptive mutation factor and crossover rate. This algorithm enhances the original DE_BO by incorporating adaptive control of the mutation factor (F) and crossover rate (CR) in the Differential Evolution (DE) component. The adaptation is based on the success rate of the DE's previous iterations, aiming to dynamically adjust exploration and exploitation. It also includes a local search step using L-BFGS-B to refine the best solution found by DE.


- DE_ABS_BO: 0.1630, 285.26 seconds, DE-ABS-BO: Differential Evolution with Adaptive Batch Size Bayesian Optimization. This algorithm combines the Differential Evolution (DE) acquisition function optimization from DE_BO with the adaptive batch size strategy from EI_ABS_BO. Additionally, it incorporates a dynamic adjustment of the DE's mutation factor (F) and crossover rate (CR) based on the optimization progress. The algorithm uses a Gaussian Process (GP) surrogate model and the Expected Improvement (EI) acquisition function. The adaptive batch size balances exploration and exploitation based on the GP's uncertainty, while the dynamic DE parameters enhance the acquisition function optimization.


- ADRBF_BO: 0.1627, 1193.00 seconds, Adaptive DE with RBF Bandwidth Bayesian Optimization (ADRBF_BO): This algorithm combines the strengths of Differential Evolution (DE) for acquisition function optimization with adaptive RBF kernel bandwidth adjustment in Bayesian Optimization. It employs a Gaussian Process (GP) as the surrogate model and Expected Improvement (EI) as the acquisition function. The RBF kernel bandwidth is dynamically tuned using the median heuristic. The DE parameters (mutation factor F and crossover rate CR) are adaptively adjusted during the optimization process based on the success rate of the DE iterations. This aims to improve the exploration and exploitation balance of the algorithm.




The selected solutions to update are:
