You are a highly skilled computer scientist in the field of natural computing. Your task is to design novel metaheuristic algorithms to solve black box optimization problems


The optimization algorithm should handle a wide range of tasks, which is evaluated on the BBOB test suite of 24 noiseless functions. Your task is to write the optimization algorithm in Python code. The code should contain an `__init__(self, budget, dim)` function and the function `__call__(self, func)`, which should optimize the black box function `func` using `self.budget` function evaluations.
The func() can only be called as many times as the budget allows, not more. Each of the optimization functions has a search space between -5.0 (lower bound) and 5.0 (upper bound). The dimensionality can be varied.
As an expert of numpy, scipy, scikit-learn, torch, gpytorch, you are allowed to use these libraries. Do not use any other libraries unless they cannot be replaced by the above libraries.  Do not remove the comments from the code.
Name the class based on the characteristics of the algorithm with a template '<characteristics>BO'.

Give an excellent, novel and computationally efficient Bayesian Optimization algorithm to solve this task, give it a concise but comprehensive key-word-style description with the main ideas and justify your decision about the algorithm.

The current population of algorithms already evaluated(name, score, runtime and description):
- TrustRegionBO: 0.1936, 111.09 seconds, **TrustRegionBO**: This algorithm implements a Bayesian Optimization strategy that uses a Gaussian Process (GP) surrogate model with a Trust Region approach. It combines the benefits of global exploration with local exploitation by focusing the search within a dynamically adjusted trust region. The acquisition function is based on Expected Improvement (EI), and the trust region size is adapted based on the agreement between the GP model's predictions and the actual function evaluations. To avoid exceeding the budget, the local search within the trust region is performed using the GP model instead of directly evaluating the objective function.


- EfficientHybridBO: 0.1555, 8.55 seconds, **EfficientHybridBO**: This algorithm combines an initial space-filling Latin Hypercube sampling (LHS) design with a Gaussian Process (GP) surrogate model and an Expected Improvement (EI) acquisition function. It uses a computationally efficient nearest neighbor approach to estimate the GP's hyperparameters, specifically the lengthscale, to reduce the computational burden associated with traditional GP hyperparameter optimization. A simple yet effective batch selection strategy based on sorting the acquisition function values is used to select the next points for evaluation.


- GradientEnhancedBO: 0.0000, 0.00 seconds, **GradientEnhancedBO**: This algorithm enhances Bayesian Optimization by incorporating gradient information to improve the accuracy of the Gaussian Process (GP) surrogate model and guide the search towards promising regions. It uses a combination of Latin Hypercube sampling for initial exploration and gradient-based optimization to refine the search. The acquisition function is augmented with a gradient-based term to encourage exploration in regions with high potential for improvement. The GP model is fitted using both function values and gradient information.


- BayesOptimisticBO: 0.0000, 0.00 seconds, **BayesOptimisticBO**: This algorithm employs a Gaussian Process (GP) surrogate model with an Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) acquisition function for Bayesian Optimization. To enhance exploration and avoid premature convergence, it introduces a dynamic exploration-exploitation trade-off by adjusting the UCB's exploration parameter based on the optimization progress. The algorithm also incorporates a local search step using the L-BFGS-B optimizer to refine promising solutions found by the GP-UCB search. This hybrid approach aims to balance global exploration with local exploitation for efficient optimization.




The selected solutions to update are:
