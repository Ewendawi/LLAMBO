# Description
**AdaptiveLengthscaleBO**: This algorithm builds upon the EfficientHybridBO framework by introducing an adaptive lengthscale strategy for the Gaussian Process (GP) surrogate model. Instead of using a fixed nearest-neighbor-based lengthscale estimation throughout the optimization process, it dynamically adjusts the lengthscale based on the optimization progress. Specifically, it starts with a more global lengthscale early on to encourage exploration and gradually reduces it as the optimization progresses to focus on local exploitation. This adaptation is achieved by linearly interpolating between a larger initial lengthscale and the nearest-neighbor-based lengthscale, with the interpolation weight determined by the fraction of the budget consumed. This allows for a better balance between exploration and exploitation during the optimization process.

# Justification
The key idea is to adapt the lengthscale of the GP kernel during the optimization. A larger lengthscale promotes exploration by smoothing the GP predictions and encouraging sampling in unexplored regions. A smaller lengthscale promotes exploitation by allowing the GP to fit the observed data more closely and focusing the search on promising regions. By starting with a larger lengthscale and gradually reducing it, the algorithm can effectively balance exploration and exploitation.

The nearest neighbor approach for lengthscale estimation is computationally efficient. The added computational cost of the adaptive lengthscale strategy is minimal, as it only involves a linear interpolation. The linear interpolation is a simple and effective way to control the transition between exploration and exploitation.
