# Description
**GradientEnhancedBO (GEBO):** This algorithm leverages gradient information to enhance the efficiency of Bayesian Optimization. It uses a Gaussian Process (GP) surrogate model and incorporates gradient observations into the GP training data. The acquisition function combines the predicted mean and variance from the GP with a gradient-based exploration term, encouraging the algorithm to explore regions with promising gradients. To further improve performance, GEBO employs a multi-start local optimization strategy to refine the search around promising candidate points identified by the acquisition function.

# Justification
The key components are justified as follows:
1.  **Gradient Information:** Incorporating gradient information into the GP model can significantly improve the accuracy of the surrogate model, especially in high-dimensional spaces. This allows the algorithm to make more informed decisions about where to sample next.
2.  **Gradient-Based Exploration:** The acquisition function includes a term that encourages exploration in regions with high gradients. This helps the algorithm to efficiently identify promising areas of the search space.
3.  **Multi-Start Local Optimization:** Performing local optimization around promising candidate points helps to refine the search and converge to the global optimum more quickly. This is particularly useful for complex, multi-modal functions.
4. The previous `AdaptiveVarianceBO` had a `TypeError` because the `sample_weight` argument is not available in the `GaussianProcessRegressor.fit()` method in the version of scikit-learn being used. The sparse GP approximation was removed to avoid this error and simplify the algorithm.
