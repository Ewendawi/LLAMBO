# Description
**GBO: Gradient-Boosted Bayesian Optimization:** This algorithm leverages gradient boosting to enhance the surrogate model's accuracy and adaptability. Instead of relying solely on a Gaussian Process, it uses a gradient-boosted tree model (specifically, HistGradientBoostingRegressor from scikit-learn) as the primary surrogate. This allows for capturing more complex relationships in the data and handling potential discontinuities or non-smoothness in the objective function. The acquisition function is based on the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB), and the exploration-exploitation trade-off is controlled by an adaptive exploration factor. Initial sampling is performed using a Latin Hypercube design. To mitigate the NaN error encountered in DIBO, a check for NaN values is added before fitting the model, and a simple imputation strategy (replacing NaNs with the mean) is employed if necessary.

# Justification
The key components and changes are justified as follows:

*   **Gradient-Boosted Trees as Surrogate:** Gradient boosting is chosen for its ability to model complex functions and handle non-smoothness, which can be an advantage over GPs with fixed kernels. HistGradientBoostingRegressor is computationally efficient and robust.
*   **Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) Acquisition:** UCB is used for its simplicity and effectiveness in balancing exploration and exploitation.
*   **Adaptive Exploration Factor:** The exploration factor in UCB is dynamically adjusted to encourage more exploration early on and more exploitation later in the optimization process.
*   **Latin Hypercube Sampling:** LHS is used for initial sampling to provide a good space-filling design.
*   **NaN Handling:** The error from DIBO indicated the presence of NaN values in the input to the Gaussian Process Regressor. To address this, a check for NaN values is implemented before fitting the model. If NaNs are found, they are replaced with the mean of the corresponding feature. This imputation strategy is simple and effective for preventing the error.
*   **Computational Efficiency:** HistGradientBoostingRegressor is designed for efficiency, and the overall algorithm is structured to minimize computational overhead.
