However, the search space is still large enough to require an efficient optimization algorithm.\n\n#### Algorithm Design\nBased on the problem analysis, we propose a Bayesian Optimization algorithm with the following components:\n\n*   Sampling Strategy: We will use a quasi-Monte Carlo method with a Halton sequence to sample the initial points. This method is known for its desirable discrepancy properties and is well-suited for low-dimensional problems.\n*   Surrogate Model: We will use a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model with a Matern kernel to model the objective function.

Your tasks are to analyze the problem, design a feasible algorithm, and implement it using Bayesian Optimization.\n## Task Instruction\nYou need to act as a mathematician, computer scientist, and programmer independently.\n\n**as a mathematician speciliazed in optimization**\n- Identify the key characteristics of the problelms relevant to optimization, such as its multi-modality, separability, and the location of its global minimum.\n- Analyze the problem, focusing on the challenges posed by the problems for optimization algorithms. Consider aspects like local optima, ruggedness, and the search space dimensionality.\n\n**as a computer scientist specialized in bayesian optimization**\n- Based on the problem analysis, propose and compare at least three conceptually different Bayesian Optimization strategies to achieve the best performance on the given problems.\n- You can choose from less complex and more widely applicable approaches(low aggressiveness), or more advanced and specialized techniques(high aggressiveness) tailored to the specific challenges of the problem. Banlance the trade-offs between reward and risk based on AGGRESSIVENESS (0.0-1.0):0.40 \n- Review your choices and design a specific Bayesian Optimization algorithm:\n- Sampling Strategy: Briefly compare popular strategies. Then, explore and justify the selection of a potentially more advanced or specialized sampling technique relevant to the problems' characteristics, such as a quasi-Monte Carlo method with desirable discrepancy properties or a sequential design strategy tailored for exploration.\n- The budget will be provided as a hyperparameter. Choose a strategy to balance n_initial_points and n_iterations. The total number of evaluations should not exceed the budget.\n- Surrogate Model: Briefly compare the standard Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) with common kernels. Then, investigate and justify the choice of a potentially more advanced or specialized surrogate model. Explain the potential advantages of this choice over standard GPR.\n- Choose a metric to evaluate the model, e.g., negative log-likelihood, or other relevant metrics. Justify your choice.\n- Acquisition Function: Briefly compare standard acquisition functions. Then, consider and justify the selection of a potentially more innovative acquisition function designed to handle multi-modality or improve exploration efficiency, such as Thompson Sampling, Information Gain-based approaches, or those incorporating risk or regret considerations. Explain the rationale behind your choice.\n- Choose the promising hyperparameters for the acquisition function, surrogate model, and other components.\n- Other Possible Techniques: Discuss the potential benefits of incorporating cutting-edge techniques within the Bayesian Optimization framework for this specific problem. Explain how these techniques could address the identified challenges.\n- Pseudocode: Write down the detailed steps of your chosen Bayesian Optimization algorithm in plain pseudocode, highlighting any novel components or adaptations.\n\n**as a programmer specialized in python**\n- Name the algorithm using a descriptive name that reflects the chosen components, potentially highlighting the novel aspect of the algorithm.\n- Implement the algorithm in Python strictly following the provided code structure guide. Ensure that the implementation aligns with the pseudocode developed in the previous step, paying particular attention to the implementation of any novel methods.\n- Code Implementation only contain the algorithm class. No usage examples\n- You are allowed to use numpy, scipy scikit-learn and Gpy.\n- Use other libraries only if they can not be repalced by the above libraries. \n\n## Problem Description\nthe ThreeHumpCamel function\ndimensions:2, Bounds: (array([-5., -5.]), array([5., 5.]))\n## Code Structure Guide\n```python\nfrom typing import Callable\nfrom scipy.stats import qmc # If you are using QMC sampling.

            "description": "#### Problem Analysis\nThe Griewank function is a multi-modal optimization problem with many local minima. The function is defined as $G(x) = \\sum_{i=1}^d x_i^2 / 4000 - \\prod_{i=1}^d \\cos(x_i / \\sqrt{i}) + 1$, where $d$ is the dimension of the problem. The global minimum is at $z = (0, ..., 0)$ with $G(z) = 0$. The problem has a large search space with bounds $[-600, 600]^d$.\n\nThe key characteristics of the problem relevant to optimization are:\n- **Multi-modality**: The problem has many local minima, which makes it challenging for optimization algorithms to find the global minimum.\n- **Separability**: The problem is separable, meaning that each dimension can be optimized independently.\n- **Location of global minimum**: The global minimum is at $z = (0, ..., 0)$.\n\nThe challenges posed by the problem for optimization algorithms are:\n- **Local optima**: The problem has many local minima, which can trap optimization algorithms.\n- **Ruggedness**: The problem has a rugged landscape, which makes it difficult for optimization algorithms to converge to the global minimum.\n- **Search space dimensionality**: The problem has a high dimensionality, which increases the difficulty of the optimization problem.\n\n#### Algorithm Design\nTo address the challenges posed by the problem, we propose a Bayesian Optimization (BO) algorithm with the following components:\n- **Sampling Strategy**: We will use a quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) sampling strategy to sample points in the search space. QMC sampling is a method for generating points in a high-dimensional space that are uniformly distributed and have good discrepancy properties.\n- **Surrogate Model**: We will use a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) with a Matern kernel as the surrogate model. The Matern kernel is a good choice for problems with multiple local minima.\n- **Acquisition Function**: We will use the Expected Improvement (EI) acquisition function, which is a popular choice for BO. EI balances the trade-off between exploration and exploitation.\n- **Budget Allocation**: We will allocate the budget to balance the number of initial points and the number of iterations. We will use a strategy to allocate the budget based on the dimensionality of the problem.\n\nWe will implement the algorithm in Python using the GPy library for GPR and the scipy library for QMC sampling.",

The function is defined as $G(x) = \\sum_{i=1}^d x_i^2 / 4000 - \\prod_{i=1}^d \\cos(x_i / \\sqrt{i}) + 1$, where $d$ is the dimension of the problem. The global minimum is at $z = (0, ..., 0)$ with $G(z) = 0$. The problem has a large search space with bounds $[-600, 600]^d$.\n\nThe key characteristics of the problem relevant to optimization are:\n- **Multi-modality**: The problem has many local minima, which makes it challenging for optimization algorithms to find the global minimum.\n- **Separability**: The problem is separable, meaning that each dimension can be optimized independently.\n- **Location of global minimum**: The global minimum is at $z = (0, ..., 0)$.\n\nThe challenges posed by the problem for optimization algorithms are:\n- **Local optima**: The problem has many local minima, which can trap optimization algorithms.\n- **Ruggedness**: The problem has a rugged landscape, which makes it difficult for optimization algorithms to converge to the global minimum.\n- **Search space dimensionality**: The problem has a high dimensionality, which increases the difficulty of the optimization problem.\n\n#### Algorithm Design\nTo address the challenges posed by the problem, we propose a Bayesian Optimization (BO) algorithm with the following components:\n- **Sampling Strategy**: We will use a quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) sampling strategy to sample points in the search space. QMC sampling is a method for generating points in a high-dimensional space that are uniformly distributed and have good discrepancy properties.\n- **Surrogate Model**: We will use a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) with a Matern kernel as the surrogate model. The Matern kernel is a good choice for problems with multiple local minima.\n- **Acquisition Function**: We will use the Expected Improvement (EI) acquisition function, which is a popular choice for BO. EI balances the trade-off between exploration and exploitation.\n- **Budget Allocation**: We will allocate the budget to balance the number of initial points and the number of iterations. We will use a strategy to allocate the budget based on the dimensionality of the problem.\n\nWe will implement the algorithm in Python using the GPy library for GPR and the scipy library for QMC sampling.\n\n### /Description\n\n### Code\n```python\nfrom typing import Callable\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.stats import qmc\nfrom GPy.models import GPRegression\nfrom GPy.kern import Matern\n\nclass GriewankBO:\n    def __init__(self):\n        # Initialize optimizer settings\n        self.acquisition_function = 'EI'\n        self.surrogate_model = 'GPR'\n        self.sampling_strategy = 'QMC'\n\n    def _sample_points(self, n_points):\n        # Sample points using QMC\n        sampler = qmc.Halton(d=6, scramble=False)\n        points = sampler.random(n=n_points)\n        points = points * (600 - (-600)) + (-600)\n        return points\n\n    def _fit_model(self, X, y):\n        # Fit and tune surrogate model\n        kernel = Matern(input_dim=6, nu=2.5)\n        model = GPRegression(X, y, kernel)\n        model.optimize()\n        return model\n\n    def _acquisition_function(self, X, model):\n        # Implement acquisition function\n        if self.acquisition_function == 'EI':\n            from GPyOpt.acquisitions import AcquisitionEI\n            acquisition = AcquisitionEI(model, X)\n            return acquisition.acquisition_function(X)\n        else:\n            raise ValueError('Invalid acquisition function')\n\n    def optimize(self, objective_fn: Callable[[np.ndarray], np.ndarray], bounds: np.ndarray, budget: int) -> tuple[np.ndarray, np.ndarray, tuple[np.ndarray, str], int]:\n        # Main minimize optimization loop\n        self.n_initial_points = int(0.2 * budget)\n        self.n_iterations = budget - self.n_initial_points\n        X_init = self._sample_points(self.n_initial_points)\n        y_init = objective_fn(X_init)\n        model = self._fit_model(X_init, y_init)\n        all_x = X_init\n        all_y = y_init\n        model_losses = np.zeros(self.n_iterations + 1)\n        model_losses[0] = -model.log_likelihood()\n        loss_name = 'negative log-likelihood'\n        for i in range(self.n_iterations):\n            acquisition_values = self._acquisition_function(all_x, model)\n            x_new = all_x[np.argmax(acquisition_values)]\n            y_new = objective_fn(x_new.reshape(1, -1))\n            all_x = np.vstack((all_x, x_new))\n            all_y = np.vstack((all_y, y_new))\n            model = self._fit_model(all_x, all_y)\n            model_losses[i + 1] = -model.log_likelihood()\n        return all_y, all_x, (model_losses, loss_name), self.n_initial_points\n```\n\n### /Code",

This approach can be more effective than EI for functions with multiple local minima.\n\nBased on the problem analysis and the proposed strategies, we design a specific Bayesian Optimization algorithm that incorporates the following components:\n\n*   **Sampling Strategy**: We choose to use QMC sampling with a Sobol sequence generator, which provides a more uniform coverage of the search space compared to random sampling.\n*   **Surrogate Model**: We use GPR with a Matern kernel, which is a flexible and powerful kernel that can capture complex relationships between the variables.\n*   **Acquisition Function**: We use EI, which is a widely used and well-established acquisition function that balances exploration and exploitation.\n*   **Budget Allocation**: We allocate the budget by setting the number of initial points (n_initial_points) to 10 and the number of iterations (n_iterations) to the remaining budget minus the initial points.\n*   **Model Evaluation Metric**: We use the negative log-likelihood (NLL) as the metric to evaluate the surrogate model.",

This approach can be more effective than EI for functions with multiple local minima.\n\nBased on the problem analysis and the proposed strategies, we design a specific Bayesian Optimization algorithm that incorporates the following components:\n\n*   **Sampling Strategy**: We choose to use QMC sampling with a Sobol sequence generator, which provides a more uniform coverage of the search space compared to random sampling.\n*   **Surrogate Model**: We use GPR with a Matern kernel, which is a flexible and powerful kernel that can capture complex relationships between the variables.\n*   **Acquisition Function**: We use EI, which is a widely used and well-established acquisition function that balances exploration and exploitation.\n*   **Budget Allocation**: We allocate the budget by setting the number of initial points (n_initial_points) to 10 and the number of iterations (n_iterations) to the remaining budget minus the initial points.\n*   **Model Evaluation Metric**: We use the negative log-likelihood (NLL) as the metric to evaluate the surrogate model.\n\n### /Description\n\n### Code\n```python\nfrom typing import Callable\nfrom scipy.stats import qmc\nimport numpy as np\nfrom botorch.fit import fit_gpytorch_mll\nfrom botorch.models import SingleTaskGP\nfrom botorch.acquisition import ExpectedImprovement\nfrom gpytorch.mlls import ExactMarginalLogLikelihood\n\nclass QMCEIBO:\n    def __init__(self):\n        # Initialize optimizer settings\n        self.n_initial_points = None\n        self.n_iterations = None\n        # Configure acquisition function\n        self.acq_func = ExpectedImprovement\n\n    def _sample_points(self, n_points, bounds):\n        # sample points using QMC\n        sampler = qmc.Sobol(d=bounds.shape[1], scramble=True)\n        points = sampler.random(n=n_points)\n        points = qmc.scale(points, bounds[0], bounds[1])\n        return points\n\n    def _fit_model(self, X, y):\n        # Fit and tune surrogate model using GPR\n        model = SingleTaskGP(X, y)\n        mll = ExactMarginalLogLikelihood(model.likelihood, model)\n        fit_gpytorch_mll(mll)\n        return model\n\n    def _acquisition_function(self, model, X):\n        # Implement acquisition function\n        acq_func = self.acq_func(model)\n        return acq_func(X)\n\n    def optimize(self, objective_fn: Callable[[np.ndarray], np.ndarray], bounds: np.ndarray, budget: int) -> tuple[np.ndarray, np.ndarray, tuple[np.ndarray, str], int]:\n        # Main minimize optimization loop\n        self.n_initial_points = 10\n        self.n_iterations = budget - self.n_initial_points\n        # Sample initial points\n        initial_points = self._sample_points(self.n_initial_points, bounds)\n        initial_values = objective_fn(initial_points)\n        # Initialize model and acquisition function\n        model = self._fit_model(initial_points, initial_values)\n        # Initialize model losses\n        model_losses = np.zeros(self.n_iterations + 1)\n        model_losses[0] = -model.likelihood.noise.mean().item()\n        # Optimization loop\n        all_x = initial_points\n        all_y = initial_values\n        for i in range(self.n_iterations):\n            # Compute acquisition function values\n            acq_values = self._acquisition_function(model, all_x)\n            # Select next point\n            next_point = all_x[np.argmax(acq_values)]\n            # Evaluate objective function at next point\n            next_value = objective_fn(next_point[np.newaxis, :])\n            # Update model and acquisition function\n            all_x = np.vstack((all_x, next_point))\n            all_y = np.vstack((all_y, next_value))\n            model = self._fit_model(all_x, all_y)\n            # Update model losses\n            model_losses[i + 1] = -model.likelihood.noise.mean().item()\n        return all_y, all_x, (model_losses, 'negative_log_likelihood'), self.n_initial_points\n\n```\n\n### /Code",

            "description": "### Problem Analysis\nThe Michalewicz function is a challenging benchmark problem for optimization algorithms due to its multi-modality, high dimensionality (in this case, 6), and the presence of many local minima. The function's rugged landscape makes it difficult for gradient-based methods to converge to the global minimum. The location of the global minimum is not analytically known, and it is highly dependent on the dimensionality. The separability of the function is low, meaning that changes in one dimension can significantly affect the function value, making it hard to optimize each dimension independently. The given bounds of [0, pi] for each dimension further complicate the search space, as they restrict the search within a relatively narrow range, increasing the risk of being trapped in local optima. The function's sinusoidal nature introduces many flat regions and sharp peaks, demanding robust exploration and exploitation strategies. The 6-dimensional nature of the problem makes it challenging because the search space grows exponentially with the number of dimensions. It requires algorithms to efficiently explore the space and avoid premature convergence to suboptimal solutions.\n\n### Algorithm Design\nGiven the challenging characteristics of the Michalewicz function, a robust Bayesian Optimization strategy is needed. A high level of aggressiveness (0.8) implies a preference for a more advanced approach that balances exploration and exploitation efficiently, even if it involves some risk of over-exploration.\n\n**Comparison of BO Strategies and Choice**\n\n1.  **Standard BO (Low Aggressiveness):** Uses Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) with a standard kernel (e.g., RBF), Expected Improvement (EI) acquisition function, and random initial sampling. This approach is simple and widely applicable but may struggle with the multi-modality of the Michalewicz function, especially in higher dimensions, and may not be aggressive enough for this task.\n2.  **BO with Improved Exploration (Medium Aggressiveness):** Uses GPR with a Mat\u00e9rn kernel, Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) acquisition, and Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) for initial points. The Mat\u00e9rn kernel can better handle non-smooth functions, UCB encourages exploration, and LHS provides better coverage of the search space initially. This approach is more robust but may still not be efficient enough for the complex landscape of the Michalewicz function and may be too conservative.\n3.  **BO with Thompson Sampling and Deep Kernel Learning (High Aggressiveness):** Uses a Deep Kernel Learning (DKL) surrogate model, Thompson Sampling acquisition, and a quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) initial sampling. DKL can capture more complex relationships in the data, Thompson Sampling is known for its good exploration-exploitation balance, and QMC provides a better initial distribution of points. This approach is the most aggressive, aiming to model complex function landscapes and efficiently navigate the search space.\n\n**Chosen Strategy:**\n\nGiven the high aggressiveness (0.8), **BO with Thompson Sampling and Deep Kernel Learning** is the chosen strategy. This strategy is tailored to handle the multi-modality and complex landscape of the Michalewicz function by leveraging the power of deep learning to model the underlying function and using Thompson Sampling for exploration-exploitation.\n**Sampling Strategy:**\n\n*   **Comparison:**\n    *   **Random Sampling:** Simple but can lead to poor space coverage, especially in higher dimensions.\n    *   **Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS):** Provides better coverage than random sampling but might still not be optimal for very complex landscapes.\n    *   **Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) Sampling:** Provides a low-discrepancy sequence, leading to more uniform sampling and better coverage of the search space.\n*   **Choice:** **Sobol sequence QMC sampling** will be used due to its superior space-filling properties compared to random or LHS, making it more suitable for exploring a complex, high-dimensional space like the Michalewicz function.\n\n**Budget Allocation:**\n\n*   A fixed ratio will be used to determine `n_initial_points` and `n_iterations` based on the budget. With a high aggressiveness, a larger initial sample size is preferred. The initial sample size will be 20% of the budget. The remaining evaluations are used for iterations.\n\n**Surrogate Model:**\n\n*   **Comparison:**\n    *   **Gaussian Process Regression (GPR):** A standard choice, but its performance depends on the kernel selection. It may struggle with highly non-linear functions.\n    *   **Deep Kernel Learning (DKL):** Combines the flexibility of neural networks with the probabilistic nature of GP, allowing for a more accurate and powerful representation of complex functions.\n*   **Choice:** **Deep Kernel Learning (DKL)** will be used. DKL uses a neural network to learn a feature map that is then used as input to a Gaussian process. This allows DKL to capture more complex relationships in the data compared to standard GPR, which is especially useful for the rugged landscape of the Michalewicz function. The neural network structure will consist of two hidden layers with 32 and 16 neurons respectively, using ReLU activation function.\n\n**Metric:**\n\n*   **Choice:** **Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL)** will be used to evaluate the model. NLL is a good measure of how well the probabilistic model (DKL) fits the data. Minimizing NLL encourages the model to assign high probabilities to observed data points, thus improving the model's predictive ability.\n\n**Acquisition Function:**\n\n*   **Comparison:**\n    *   **Expected Improvement (EI):** Balances exploration and exploitation but can be prone to getting stuck in local optima.\n    *   **Upper Confidence Bound (UCB):** Encourages exploration but may be too conservative for multimodal problems.\n    *   **Thompson Sampling (TS):** Uses posterior sampling for exploration and exploitation, known for its robustness and effectiveness in various scenarios, especially when the uncertainty is well modeled.\n*   **Choice:** **Thompson Sampling (TS)** is chosen. TS draws samples from the posterior distribution of the surrogate model and selects the next point to evaluate based on the sample that minimizes the objective function. This approach is particularly effective for multimodal functions because it naturally explores regions with high uncertainty while also exploiting promising areas.\n\n**Hyperparameters:**\n\n*   **DKL:** The neural network will have two hidden layers (32 and 16 neurons) and ReLU activation functions. The base GP will use a RBF kernel.\n*   **QMC:** Use Sobol sequence.\n*   **Thompson Sampling:** No additional hyperparameters are needed.\n\n**Other Possible Techniques:**\n\n*   **Multi-start optimization:** After the Bayesian optimization, local optimization can be performed using the best points found.\n*   **Batch Bayesian Optimization:** Instead of selecting one point at a time, select a batch of points to evaluate in parallel.\n*   **Adaptive Kernels:** Kernels can be adapted during the optimization process to reflect the local structure of the objective function.\n\n**Pseudocode:**\n\n```\nAlgorithm: ThompsonSamplingDKL_BO\n\n1.  Initialize:\n    - Define objective function `objective_fn`, bounds, and budget.\n    - Set `n_initial_points` to 20% of the budget.\n    - Set `n_iterations` to budget - `n_initial_points`.\n    - Generate `n_initial_points` using Sobol sequence QMC sampling within the bounds.\n    - Evaluate the initial points using `objective_fn`.\n    - Initialize `all_x` with the initial points and `all_y` with the corresponding objective function values.\n    - Initialize an empty list `model_losses`.\n\n2.  Fit Initial Model:\n    - Fit the DKL surrogate model to the initial data (X, y).\n    - Evaluate the model using Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL) metric and append it to `model_losses`.\n\n3.  For i = 1 to `n_iterations`:\n    -  Draw a sample from the posterior distribution of the DKL model at a set of candidate points (e.g., generated randomly or using QMC)\n    - Evaluate the sample and find the point that minimizes the sampled function value.\n    - Evaluate the objective function at selected point.\n    - Append the selected point to `all_x` and the objective value to `all_y`.\n    - Fit the DKL surrogate model using the updated data (all_x, all_y).\n    - Evaluate the model using NLL and append the loss to `model_losses`.\n\n4.  Return:\n    - Return `all_y`, `all_x`, `model_losses`, and `n_initial_points`.\n```",

Minimizing NLL encourages the model to assign high probabilities to observed data points, thus improving the model's predictive ability.\n\n**Acquisition Function:**\n\n*   **Comparison:**\n    *   **Expected Improvement (EI):** Balances exploration and exploitation but can be prone to getting stuck in local optima.\n    *   **Upper Confidence Bound (UCB):** Encourages exploration but may be too conservative for multimodal problems.\n    *   **Thompson Sampling (TS):** Uses posterior sampling for exploration and exploitation, known for its robustness and effectiveness in various scenarios, especially when the uncertainty is well modeled.\n*   **Choice:** **Thompson Sampling (TS)** is chosen. TS draws samples from the posterior distribution of the surrogate model and selects the next point to evaluate based on the sample that minimizes the objective function. This approach is particularly effective for multimodal functions because it naturally explores regions with high uncertainty while also exploiting promising areas.\n\n**Hyperparameters:**\n\n*   **DKL:** The neural network will have two hidden layers (32 and 16 neurons) and ReLU activation functions. The base GP will use a RBF kernel.\n*   **QMC:** Use Sobol sequence.\n*   **Thompson Sampling:** No additional hyperparameters are needed.\n\n**Other Possible Techniques:**\n\n*   **Multi-start optimization:** After the Bayesian optimization, local optimization can be performed using the best points found.\n*   **Batch Bayesian Optimization:** Instead of selecting one point at a time, select a batch of points to evaluate in parallel.\n*   **Adaptive Kernels:** Kernels can be adapted during the optimization process to reflect the local structure of the objective function.\n\n**Pseudocode:**\n\n```\nAlgorithm: ThompsonSamplingDKL_BO\n\n1.  Initialize:\n    - Define objective function `objective_fn`, bounds, and budget.\n    - Set `n_initial_points` to 20% of the budget.\n    - Set `n_iterations` to budget - `n_initial_points`.\n    - Generate `n_initial_points` using Sobol sequence QMC sampling within the bounds.\n    - Evaluate the initial points using `objective_fn`.\n    - Initialize `all_x` with the initial points and `all_y` with the corresponding objective function values.\n    - Initialize an empty list `model_losses`.\n\n2.  Fit Initial Model:\n    - Fit the DKL surrogate model to the initial data (X, y).\n    - Evaluate the model using Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL) metric and append it to `model_losses`.\n\n3.  For i = 1 to `n_iterations`:\n    -  Draw a sample from the posterior distribution of the DKL model at a set of candidate points (e.g., generated randomly or using QMC)\n    - Evaluate the sample and find the point that minimizes the sampled function value.\n    - Evaluate the objective function at selected point.\n    - Append the selected point to `all_x` and the objective value to `all_y`.\n    - Fit the DKL surrogate model using the updated data (all_x, all_y).\n    - Evaluate the model using NLL and append the loss to `model_losses`.\n\n4.  Return:\n    - Return `all_y`, `all_x`, `model_losses`, and `n_initial_points`.\n```\n### /Description\n\n### Code\n```python\nfrom typing import Callable\nfrom scipy.stats import qmc\nimport numpy as np\nimport GPy\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nimport torch.optim as optim\nfrom torch.distributions import Normal\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\n\nclass DeepKernelLearning:\n    def __init__(self, input_dim, hidden_dim1=32, hidden_dim2=16, learning_rate=0.01, epochs=1000):\n        self.input_dim = input_dim\n        self.hidden_dim1 = hidden_dim1\n        self.hidden_dim2 = hidden_dim2\n        self.learning_rate = learning_rate\n        self.epochs = epochs\n        self.scaler_X = StandardScaler()\n        self.scaler_y = StandardScaler()\n        self.model = None\n        self.optimizer = None\n        self.loss_fn = lambda y_pred, y_true: -Normal(y_pred, 1e-5).log_prob(y_true).mean()\n    \n    def _build_model(self):\n        model = nn.Sequential(\n            nn.Linear(self.input_dim, self.hidden_dim1),\n            nn.ReLU(),\n            nn.Linear(self.hidden_dim1, self.hidden_dim2),\n            nn.ReLU(),\n            nn.Linear(self.hidden_dim2, 1)\n        )\n        return model\n    \n    def fit(self, X, y):\n        X = np.array(X)\n        y = np.array(y)\n        if X.ndim == 1:\n            X = X.reshape(-1, 1)\n        if y.ndim == 1:\n            y = y.reshape(-1, 1)\n        X_scaled = self.scaler_X.fit_transform(X)\n        y_scaled = self.scaler_y.fit_transform(y)\n        X_tensor = torch.tensor(X_scaled,dtype=torch.float32)\n        y_tensor = torch.tensor(y_scaled,dtype=torch.float32)\n        self.model = self._build_model()\n        self.optimizer = optim.Adam(self.model.parameters(), lr=self.learning_rate)\n\n        for _ in range(self.epochs):\n            self.optimizer.zero_grad()\n            y_pred = self.model(X_tensor)\n            loss = self.loss_fn(y_pred, y_tensor)\n            loss.backward()\n            self.optimizer.step()\n        \n        self.gp_model = GPy.models.GPRegression(self.model(X_tensor).detach().numpy(), y_scaled, GPy.kern.RBF(input_dim=1,ARD=True))\n        self.gp_model.optimize_restarts(num_restarts=5, verbose=False)\n        \n    def predict(self, X):\n        X = np.array(X)\n        if X.ndim == 1:\n            X = X.reshape(-1, 1)\n        X_scaled = self.scaler_X.transform(X)\n        X_tensor = torch.tensor(X_scaled, dtype=torch.float32)\n        with torch.no_grad():\n            y_pred = self.model(X_tensor).detach().numpy()\n        y_pred_unscaled = self.scaler_y.inverse_transform(y_pred)\n        return y_pred_unscaled\n    \n    def predict_dist(self, X):\n        X = np.array(X)\n        if X.ndim == 1:\n            X = X.reshape(-1, 1)\n        X_scaled = self.scaler_X.transform(X)\n        X_tensor = torch.tensor(X_scaled, dtype=torch.float32)\n        with torch.no_grad():\n          y_pred = self.model(X_tensor).detach().numpy()\n        y_pred_unscaled = self.scaler_y.inverse_transform(y_pred)\n        y_pred_unscaled_gp, var_gp = self.gp_model.predict(self.model(X_tensor).detach().numpy())\n        var_unscaled_gp = var_gp * self.scaler_y.scale_**2\n        return y_pred_unscaled, var_unscaled_gp\n    \n    def log_likelihood(self, X, y):\n        X = np.array(X)\n        y = np.array(y)\n        if X.ndim == 1:\n            X = X.reshape(-1, 1)\n        if y.ndim == 1:\n            y = y.reshape(-1, 1)\n        X_scaled = self.scaler_X.transform(X)\n        y_scaled = self.scaler_y.transform(y)\n        X_tensor = torch.tensor(X_scaled,dtype=torch.float32)\n        y_tensor = torch.tensor(y_scaled,dtype=torch.float32)\n        with torch.no_grad():\n          y_pred = self.model(X_tensor)\n        \n        loss = self.loss_fn(y_pred, y_tensor)\n        return loss.item()\n\n\nclass ThompsonSamplingDKL_BO:\n    def __init__(self):\n        pass\n\n    def _sample_points(self, n_points, bounds):\n        sampler = qmc.Sobol(d=bounds.shape[1], scramble=True)\n        sample = sampler.random(n_points)\n        return qmc.scale(sample, bounds[0], bounds[1])\n    \n    def _fit_model(self, X, y):\n        input_dim = X.shape[1]\n        self.dkl_model = DeepKernelLearning(input_dim=input_dim)\n        self.dkl_model.fit(X, y)\n        \n    def _acquisition_function(self, X):\n        y_pred, var = self.dkl_model.predict_dist(X)\n        sampled_values = np.random.normal(y_pred.flatten(), np.sqrt(var.flatten()))\n        return sampled_values\n    \n    def optimize(self, objective_fn:Callable[[np.ndarray], np.ndarray], bounds:np.ndarray, budget:int) -> tuple[np.ndarray, np.ndarray, tuple[np.ndarray, str], int]:\n        self.n_initial_points = int(0.2 * budget)\n        self.n_iterations = budget -

This is because the `ThompsonSamplingDKL_BO` class does not pass the `input_dim` to the `DeepKernelLearning` class when it is created in the `_fit_model` method.\n\n- **Error Correction**\n  To fix this, we need to ensure that the `input_dim` is passed correctly to the `DeepKernelLearning` class. This can be done by modifying the `_fit_model` method in the `ThompsonSamplingDKL_BO` class to pass the correct `input_dim` based on the shape of the input data `X`.\n\n### Code\n```python\nfrom typing import Callable\nfrom scipy.stats import qmc\nimport numpy as np\nimport GPy\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nimport torch.optim as optim\nfrom torch.distributions import Normal\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\n\nclass DeepKernelLearning:\n    def __init__(self, input_dim, hidden_dim1=32, hidden_dim2=16, learning_rate=0.01, epochs=1000):\n        self.input_dim = input_dim\n        self.hidden_dim1 = hidden_dim1\n        self.hidden_dim2 = hidden_dim2\n        self.learning_rate = learning_rate\n        self.epochs = epochs\n        self.scaler_X = StandardScaler()\n        self.scaler_y = StandardScaler()\n        self.model = None\n        self.optimizer = None\n        self.loss_fn = lambda y_pred, y_true: -Normal(y_pred, 1e-5).log_prob(y_true).mean()\n    \n    def _build_model(self):\n        model = nn.Sequential(\n            nn.Linear(self.input_dim, self.hidden_dim1),\n            nn.ReLU(),\n            nn.Linear(self.hidden_dim1, self.hidden_dim2),\n            nn.ReLU(),\n            nn.Linear(self.hidden_dim2, 1)\n        )\n        return model\n    \n    def fit(self, X, y):\n        X = np.array(X)\n        y = np.array(y)\n        if X.ndim == 1:\n            X = X.reshape(-1, 1)\n        if y.ndim == 1:\n            y = y.reshape(-1, 1)\n        X_scaled = self.scaler_X.fit_transform(X)\n        y_scaled = self.scaler_y.fit_transform(y)\n        X_tensor = torch.tensor(X_scaled,dtype=torch.float32)\n        y_tensor = torch.tensor(y_scaled,dtype=torch.float32)\n        self.model = self._build_model()\n        self.optimizer = optim.Adam(self.model.parameters(), lr=self.learning_rate)\n\n        for _ in range(self.epochs):\n            self.optimizer.zero_grad()\n            y_pred = self.model(X_tensor)\n            loss = self.loss_fn(y_pred, y_tensor)\n            loss.backward()\n            self.optimizer.step()\n        \n        self.gp_model = GPy.models.GPRegression(self.model(X_tensor).detach().numpy(), y_scaled, GPy.kern.RBF(input_dim=1,ARD=True))\n        self.gp_model.optimize_restarts(num_restarts=5, verbose=False)\n        \n    def predict(self, X):\n        X = np.array(X)\n        if X.ndim == 1:\n            X = X.reshape(-1, 1)\n        X_scaled = self.scaler_X.transform(X)\n        X_tensor = torch.tensor(X_scaled, dtype=torch.float32)\n        with torch.no_grad():\n            y_pred = self.model(X_tensor).detach().numpy()\n        y_pred_unscaled = self.scaler_y.inverse_transform(y_pred)\n        return y_pred_unscaled\n    \n    def predict_dist(self, X):\n        X = np.array(X)\n        if X.ndim == 1:\n            X = X.reshape(-1, 1)\n        X_scaled = self.scaler_X.transform(X)\n        X_tensor = torch.tensor(X_scaled, dtype=torch.float32)\n        with torch.no_grad():\n          y_pred = self.model(X_tensor).detach().numpy()\n        y_pred_unscaled = self.scaler_y.inverse_transform(y_pred)\n        y_pred_unscaled_gp, var_gp = self.gp_model.predict(self.model(X_tensor).detach().numpy())\n        var_unscaled_gp = var_gp * self.scaler_y.scale_**2\n        return y_pred_unscaled, var_unscaled_gp\n    \n    def log_likelihood(self, X, y):\n        X = np.array(X)\n        y = np.array(y)\n        if X.ndim == 1:\n            X = X.reshape(-1, 1)\n        if y.ndim == 1:\n            y = y.reshape(-1, 1)\n        X_scaled = self.scaler_X.transform(X)\n        y_scaled = self.scaler_y.transform(y)\n        X_tensor = torch.tensor(X_scaled,dtype=torch.float32)\n        y_tensor = torch.tensor(y_scaled,dtype=torch.float32)\n        with torch.no_grad():\n          y_pred = self.model(X_tensor)\n        \n        loss = self.loss_fn(y_pred, y_tensor)\n        return loss.item()\n\n\nclass ThompsonSamplingDKL_BO:\n    def __init__(self):\n        pass\n\n    def _sample_points(self, n_points, bounds):\n        sampler = qmc.Sobol(d=bounds.shape[1], scramble=True)\n        sample = sampler.random(n_points)\n        return qmc.scale(sample, bounds[0], bounds[1])\n    \n    def _fit_model(self, X, y):\n        input_dim = X.shape[1]\n        self.dkl_model = DeepKernelLearning(input_dim=input_dim)\n        self.dkl_model.fit(X, y)\n        \n    def _acquisition_function(self, X):\n        y_pred, var = self.dkl_model.predict_dist(X)\n        sampled_values = np.random.normal(y_pred.flatten(), np.sqrt(var.flatten()))\n        return sampled_values\n    \n    def optimize(self, objective_fn:Callable[[np.ndarray], np.ndarray], bounds:np.ndarray, budget:int) -> tuple[np.ndarray, np.ndarray, tuple[np.ndarray, str], int]:\n        self.n_initial_points = int(0.2 * budget)\n        self.n_iterations = budget -

Your tasks are to analyze the problem, design a feasible algorithm, and implement it using Bayesian Optimization.\n## Task Instruction\nYou need to act as a mathematician, computer scientist, and programmer independently.\n\n**as a mathematician speciliazed in optimization**\n- Identify the key characteristics of the problelms relevant to optimization, such as its multi-modality, separability, and the location of its global minimum.\n- Analyze the problem, focusing on the challenges posed by the problems for optimization algorithms. Consider aspects like local optima, ruggedness, and the search space dimensionality.\n\n**as a computer scientist specialized in bayesian optimization**\n- Based on the problem analysis, propose and compare at least three conceptually different Bayesian Optimization strategies to achieve the best performance on the given problems.\n- You can choose from less complex and more widely applicable approaches(low aggressiveness), or more advanced and specialized techniques(high aggressiveness) tailored to the specific challenges of the problem. Banlance the trade-offs between reward and risk based on AGGRESSIVENESS (0.0-1.0):0.80 \n- Review your choices and design a specific Bayesian Optimization algorithm:\n- Sampling Strategy: Briefly compare popular strategies. Then, explore and justify the selection of a potentially more advanced or specialized sampling technique relevant to the problems' characteristics, such as a quasi-Monte Carlo method with desirable discrepancy properties or a sequential design strategy tailored for exploration.\n- The budget will be provided as a hyperparameter. Choose a strategy to balance n_initial_points and n_iterations. The total number of evaluations should not exceed the budget.\n- Surrogate Model: Briefly compare the standard Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) with common kernels. Then, investigate and justify the choice of a potentially more advanced or specialized surrogate model. Explain the potential advantages of this choice over standard GPR.\n- Choose a metric to evaluate the model, e.g., negative log-likelihood, or other relevant metrics. Justify your choice.\n- Acquisition Function: Briefly compare standard acquisition functions. Then, consider and justify the selection of a potentially more innovative acquisition function designed to handle multi-modality or improve exploration efficiency, such as Thompson Sampling, Information Gain-based approaches, or those incorporating risk or regret considerations. Explain the rationale behind your choice.\n- Choose the promising hyperparameters for the acquisition function, surrogate model, and other components.\n- Other Possible Techniques: Discuss the potential benefits of incorporating cutting-edge techniques within the Bayesian Optimization framework for this specific problem. Explain how these techniques could address the identified challenges.\n- Pseudocode: Write down the detailed steps of your chosen Bayesian Optimization algorithm in plain pseudocode, highlighting any novel components or adaptations.\n\n**as a programmer specialized in python**\n- Name the algorithm using a descriptive name that reflects the chosen components, potentially highlighting the novel aspect of the algorithm.\n- Implement the algorithm in Python strictly following the provided code structure guide. Ensure that the implementation aligns with the pseudocode developed in the previous step, paying particular attention to the implementation of any novel methods.\n- Code Implementation only contain the algorithm class. No usage examples\n- You are allowed to use numpy, scipy, scikit-learn, Gpy, torch, gpytorch and botorch.\n- Use other libraries only if they can not be repalced by the above libraries. \n\n## Problem Description\nHartmann synthetic test function.\n\n    Most commonly used is the six-dimensional version (typically evaluated on\n    `[0, 1]^6`):\n\n        H(x) = - sum_{i=1}^4 ALPHA_i exp( - sum_{j=1}^6 A_ij (x_j - P_ij)**2 )\n\n    H has a 6 local minima and a global minimum at\n\n        z = (0.20169, 0.150011, 0.476874, 0.275332, 0.311652, 0.6573)\n\n    with `H(z) = -3.32237`.\n    \ndimensions:6, Bounds: (array([0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.]), array([1., 1., 1., 1., 1., 1.]))\n## Code Structure Guide\n```python\nfrom typing import Callable\nfrom scipy.stats import qmc # If you are using QMC sampling.

            "description": "### Problem Analysis\nThe Beale function is a two-dimensional, multimodal function known for its sharp peaks and valleys, making it a challenging benchmark for optimization algorithms. Its global minimum is located at (3, 0.5), with a function value of 0. The presence of multiple local minima can easily trap gradient-based algorithms, and the steep gradients in the vicinity of the global minimum require algorithms to be robust and adaptive. The function has a relatively small search space, but its ruggedness makes it difficult for algorithms to explore efficiently, especially when the initial sampling is not close to the global minimum. The separability of the function is not evident, which means that optimizing along each dimension separately won't lead to a satisfactory solution. The major challenges for optimization algorithms are:\n1.  **Multimodality:** The presence of multiple local minima. It requires a good balance between exploration and exploitation to avoid getting stuck in a local minima.\n2.  **Ruggedness:** The sharp peaks and valleys, which can cause difficulties for algorithms that rely on smooth gradients.\n3.  **Global Minimum Location:** The global minimum is relatively isolated, thus requiring an algorithm to find it within a limited budget.\n4.  **Low Dimensionality:** While the problem is 2D, the ruggedness of the function makes it a challenging benchmark for Bayesian Optimization.\n\n### Algorithm Design\nGiven the challenges posed by the Beale function, a robust Bayesian Optimization (BO) strategy is needed. The algorithm will focus on efficient exploration to identify the promising regions and then exploit these regions to locate the global minimum.\n\n**Bayesian Optimization Strategies**\n1.  **Standard BO with GP and Expected Improvement:** This is a common approach, using Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) as the surrogate model and Expected Improvement (EI) as the acquisition function. It is a good baseline and provides a good balance between exploration and exploitation. This is a low aggressiveness approach.\n2.  **BO with Local Penalization and Multi-start:** This approach aims to address multimodality by penalizing regions that have already been explored. After a number of iterations, the algorithm will also restart with a new random initilization to escape any local minima that it may have been trapped in. This approach has intermediate aggressiveness.\n3.  **BO with Deep Kernel Learning and Thompson Sampling:** This is a more advanced approach that uses a deep neural network to learn a more flexible kernel for the surrogate model, enabling it to capture the complex function landscape better. Thompson Sampling (TS) is used as the acquisition function, which is known for its efficient exploration properties, leading to high aggressiveness.\n\nConsidering the balance between reward and risk based on 0.80 aggressiveness, we will choose the third option: **BO with Deep Kernel Learning and Thompson Sampling**.\n\n**Review and Specific Algorithm Design**\n1.  **Sampling Strategy**:\n    - We will use a **Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS)** strategy for the initial points. LHS provides good space-filling properties, ensuring a diverse initial sample.\n    - For the subsequent iterations, the acquisition function (Thompson Sampling) will guide the sampling, which is an adaptive and sequential design strategy.\n\n2.  **Budget Allocation**:\n    - The total budget will be split between initial sampling and iterations by setting `n_initial_points = int(budget * 0.2)` and `n_iterations = budget - n_initial_points`. This will ensure a good initial exploration while allowing for enough iterations to refine the search.\n\n3.  **Surrogate Model**:\n    - Instead of standard GPR with common kernels, we will use a **Deep Kernel Learning (DKL)** model. DKL uses a neural network to learn a more flexible kernel, allowing the surrogate model to capture the complex landscape of the Beale function more accurately, especially the sharp peaks and valleys. This should provide better predictive accuracy than standard GPR.\n    - We will use a neural network with two hidden layers with 10 neurons each. Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) as its activation function.\n    - The DKL model will be trained by minimizing the negative log-likelihood(NLL) of the observed data.\n\n4.  **Evaluation Metric**:\n    - We will use the **negative log-likelihood (NLL)** as the metric to evaluate the model. NLL is a proper scoring rule and a commonly used metric for probabilistic models like the GPR, and it can help to avoid overfitting to the data.\n\n5.  **Acquisition Function**:\n    - Instead of standard acquisition functions, we will use **Thompson Sampling (TS)**. TS is a probabilistic approach that samples from the posterior distribution of the objective function. It is known for its good exploration properties and is well-suited for multimodal functions, as it encourages the algorithm to explore regions with high uncertainty.\n\n6.  **Hyperparameters**:\n    - For DKL, the learning rate is 0.01 and the number of epochs is 100.\n    - For Thompson Sampling, no additional hyperparameters are required.\n\n7.  **Other Techniques**:\n    - **Early Stopping:** We will monitor the NLL during model training and stop training early if the validation loss does not improve for several epochs. This will prevent the model from overfitting and can save computational time.\n\n8.  **Pseudocode**:\n    ```\n    Algorithm: DeepKernelThompsonBO\n    Input: objective_fn, bounds, budget\n\n    1.

                "raw_response": "### Description\n### Problem Analysis\nThe Beale function is a two-dimensional, multimodal function known for its sharp peaks and valleys, making it a challenging benchmark for optimization algorithms. Its global minimum is located at (3, 0.5), with a function value of 0. The presence of multiple local minima can easily trap gradient-based algorithms, and the steep gradients in the vicinity of the global minimum require algorithms to be robust and adaptive. The function has a relatively small search space, but its ruggedness makes it difficult for algorithms to explore efficiently, especially when the initial sampling is not close to the global minimum. The separability of the function is not evident, which means that optimizing along each dimension separately won't lead to a satisfactory solution. The major challenges for optimization algorithms are:\n1.  **Multimodality:** The presence of multiple local minima. It requires a good balance between exploration and exploitation to avoid getting stuck in a local minima.\n2.  **Ruggedness:** The sharp peaks and valleys, which can cause difficulties for algorithms that rely on smooth gradients.\n3.  **Global Minimum Location:** The global minimum is relatively isolated, thus requiring an algorithm to find it within a limited budget.\n4.  **Low Dimensionality:** While the problem is 2D, the ruggedness of the function makes it a challenging benchmark for Bayesian Optimization.\n\n### Algorithm Design\nGiven the challenges posed by the Beale function, a robust Bayesian Optimization (BO) strategy is needed. The algorithm will focus on efficient exploration to identify the promising regions and then exploit these regions to locate the global minimum.\n\n**Bayesian Optimization Strategies**\n1.  **Standard BO with GP and Expected Improvement:** This is a common approach, using Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) as the surrogate model and Expected Improvement (EI) as the acquisition function. It is a good baseline and provides a good balance between exploration and exploitation. This is a low aggressiveness approach.\n2.  **BO with Local Penalization and Multi-start:** This approach aims to address multimodality by penalizing regions that have already been explored. After a number of iterations, the algorithm will also restart with a new random initilization to escape any local minima that it may have been trapped in. This approach has intermediate aggressiveness.\n3.  **BO with Deep Kernel Learning and Thompson Sampling:** This is a more advanced approach that uses a deep neural network to learn a more flexible kernel for the surrogate model, enabling it to capture the complex function landscape better. Thompson Sampling (TS) is used as the acquisition function, which is known for its efficient exploration properties, leading to high aggressiveness.\n\nConsidering the balance between reward and risk based on 0.80 aggressiveness, we will choose the third option: **BO with Deep Kernel Learning and Thompson Sampling**.\n\n**Review and Specific Algorithm Design**\n1.  **Sampling Strategy**:\n    - We will use a **Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS)** strategy for the initial points. LHS provides good space-filling properties, ensuring a diverse initial sample.\n    - For the subsequent iterations, the acquisition function (Thompson Sampling) will guide the sampling, which is an adaptive and sequential design strategy.\n\n2.  **Budget Allocation**:\n    - The total budget will be split between initial sampling and iterations by setting `n_initial_points = int(budget * 0.2)` and `n_iterations = budget - n_initial_points`. This will ensure a good initial exploration while allowing for enough iterations to refine the search.\n\n3.  **Surrogate Model**:\n    - Instead of standard GPR with common kernels, we will use a **Deep Kernel Learning (DKL)** model. DKL uses a neural network to learn a more flexible kernel, allowing the surrogate model to capture the complex landscape of the Beale function more accurately, especially the sharp peaks and valleys. This should provide better predictive accuracy than standard GPR.\n    - We will use a neural network with two hidden layers with 10 neurons each. Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) as its activation function.\n    - The DKL model will be trained by minimizing the negative log-likelihood(NLL) of the observed data.\n\n4.  **Evaluation Metric**:\n    - We will use the **negative log-likelihood (NLL)** as the metric to evaluate the model. NLL is a proper scoring rule and a commonly used metric for probabilistic models like the GPR, and it can help to avoid overfitting to the data.\n\n5.  **Acquisition Function**:\n    - Instead of standard acquisition functions, we will use **Thompson Sampling (TS)**. TS is a probabilistic approach that samples from the posterior distribution of the objective function. It is known for its good exploration properties and is well-suited for multimodal functions, as it encourages the algorithm to explore regions with high uncertainty.\n\n6.  **Hyperparameters**:\n    - For DKL, the learning rate is 0.01 and the number of epochs is 100.\n    - For Thompson Sampling, no additional hyperparameters are required.\n\n7.  **Other Techniques**:\n    - **Early Stopping:** We will monitor the NLL during model training and stop training early if the validation loss does not improve for several epochs. This will prevent the model from overfitting and can save computational time.\n\n8.  **Pseudocode**:\n    ```\n    Algorithm: DeepKernelThompsonBO\n    Input: objective_fn, bounds, budget\n\n    1.

Your tasks are to analyze the problem, design a feasible algorithm, and implement it using Bayesian Optimization.\n## Task Instruction\nYou need to act as a mathematician, computer scientist, and programmer independently.\n\n**as a mathematician speciliazed in optimization**\n- Identify the key characteristics of the problelms relevant to optimization, such as its multi-modality, separability, and the location of its global minimum.\n- Analyze the problem, focusing on the challenges posed by the problems for optimization algorithms.

Banlance the trade-offs between reward and risk based on AGGRESSIVENESS (0.0-1.0):0.80 \n- Review your choices and design a specific Bayesian Optimization algorithm:\n- Sampling Strategy: Briefly compare popular strategies. Then, explore and justify the selection of a potentially more advanced or specialized sampling technique relevant to the problems' characteristics, such as a quasi-Monte Carlo method with desirable discrepancy properties or a sequential design strategy tailored for exploration.\n- The budget will be provided as a hyperparameter. Choose a strategy to balance n_initial_points and n_iterations. The total number of evaluations should not exceed the budget.\n- Surrogate Model: Briefly compare the standard Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) with common kernels. Then, investigate and justify the choice of a potentially more advanced or specialized surrogate model. Explain the potential advantages of this choice over standard GPR.\n- Choose a metric to evaluate the model, e.g., negative log-likelihood, or other relevant metrics. Justify your choice.\n- Acquisition Function: Briefly compare standard acquisition functions. Then, consider and justify the selection of a potentially more innovative acquisition function designed to handle multi-modality or improve exploration efficiency, such as Thompson Sampling, Information Gain-based approaches, or those incorporating risk or regret considerations. Explain the rationale behind your choice.\n- Choose the promising hyperparameters for the acquisition function, surrogate model, and other components.\n- Other Possible Techniques: Discuss the potential benefits of incorporating cutting-edge techniques within the Bayesian Optimization framework for this specific problem. Explain how these techniques could address the identified challenges.\n- Pseudocode: Write down the detailed steps of your chosen Bayesian Optimization algorithm in plain pseudocode, highlighting any novel components or adaptations.\n\n**as a programmer specialized in python**\n- Name the algorithm using a descriptive name that reflects the chosen components, potentially highlighting the novel aspect of the algorithm.\n- Implement the algorithm in Python strictly following the provided code structure guide. Ensure that the implementation aligns with the pseudocode developed in the previous step, paying particular attention to the implementation of any novel methods.\n- Code Implementation only contain the algorithm class. No usage examples\n- You are allowed to use numpy, scipy, scikit-learn, Gpy, torch, gpytorch and botorch.\n- Use other libraries only if they can not be repalced by the above libraries. \n\n## Problem Description\nPowell synthetic test function.\n\n    `d`-dim function (usually evaluated on the hypercube `[-4, 5]^d`):\n\n        P(x) = sum_{i=1}^d/4 (\n        (x_{4i-3} + 10 x_{4i-2})**2\n        + 5 (x_{4i-1} - x_{4i})**2\n        + (x_{4i-2} - 2 x_{4i-1})**4\n        + 10 (x_{4i-3} - x_{4i})**4\n        )\n\n\n    P has a global minimizer at `z = (0, ..., 0)` with `P(z) = 0`.\n    \ndimensions:6, Bounds: (array([-4., -4., -4., -4., -4., -4.]), array([5., 5., 5., 5., 5., 5.]))\n## Code Structure Guide\n```python\nfrom typing import Callable\nfrom scipy.stats import qmc # If you are using QMC sampling.

The GPR surrogate model will be fitted and updated at each iteration.\n\n### /Description\n\n### Code\n```python\nfrom typing import Callable\nfrom scipy.stats import qmc\nimport numpy as np\nfrom botorch.fit import fit_gpytorch_mll\nfrom botorch.models import SingleTaskGP\nfrom botorch.acquisition import qThompsonSampling\nfrom gpytorch.mlls import ExactMarginalLogLikelihood\n\nclass QMCTSBBO:\n    def __init__(self):\n        # Initialize optimizer settings\n        self.n_initial_points = None\n        self.n_iterations = None\n        # Configure acquisition function\n        self.acquisition_function = qThompsonSampling\n\n    def _sample_points(self, n_points):\n        # sample points using QMC\n        sampler = qmc.Halton(d=6, scramble=True)\n        points = sampler.random(n=n_points)\n        points = 9 * points - 4  # scale to bounds\n        return points\n\n    def _fit_model(self, X, y):\n        # Fit and tune surrogate model using GPR\n        model = SingleTaskGP(train_X=X, train_Y=y)\n        mll = ExactMarginalLogLikelihood(model.likelihood, model)\n        fit_gpytorch_mll(mll)\n        return model\n\n    def _acquisition_function(self, X, model):\n        # Implement Thompson Sampling acquisition function\n        acq_func = qThompsonSampling(model, num_fantasies=4)\n        values = acq_func(X)\n        return values\n\n    def optimize(self, objective_fn: Callable[[np.ndarray], np.ndarray], bounds: np.ndarray, budget: int) -> tuple[np.ndarray, np.ndarray, tuple[np.ndarray, str], int]:\n        # Main minimize optimization loop\n        self.n_initial_points = int(budget * 0.2)  # split budget between initial points and iterations\n        self.n_iterations = budget - self.n_initial_points\n        X_init = self._sample_points(self.n_initial_points)\n        y_init = objective_fn(X_init)\n        model = self._fit_model(X_init, y_init)\n        all_x = X_init\n        all_y = y_init\n        model_losses = [model.likelihood.noise.item()]  # initialize model loss\n        loss_name = 'negative log-likelihood'\n        for _ in range(self.n_iterations):\n            X_new = self._sample_points(1)\n            y_new = objective_fn(X_new)\n            all_x = np.vstack((all_x, X_new))\n            all_y = np.vstack((all_y, y_new))\n            model = self._fit_model(all_x, all_y)\n            model_losses.append(model.likelihood.noise.item())\n        return all_y, all_x, (np.array(model_losses), loss_name), self.n_initial_points\n\n```\n\n### /Code",

The function has multiple local optima, making it challenging for optimization algorithms. The function's multi-modality, separability, and ruggedness pose significant challenges for optimization algorithms.\n\n#### Algorithm Design\nTo tackle the challenges posed by the Shekel function, we propose a Bayesian Optimization (BO) algorithm that utilizes a combination of advanced techniques. Our algorithm, named `AdvancedShekelBO`, will employ the following components:\n- **Sampling Strategy**: We will use a quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) method with a Sobol sequence to generate initial points, which provides a good balance between exploration and exploitation.\n- **Surrogate Model**: We will use a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model with a Matern kernel, which is suitable for functions with multiple local optima.\n- **Acquisition Function**: We will use the Expected Improvement (EI) acquisition function, which is a popular choice for BO. To handle multi-modality, we will also consider the use of Thompson Sampling.\n- **Budget Allocation**: We will allocate the budget between the number of initial points and the number of iterations. The number of initial points will be set to 10, and the remaining budget will be used for iterations.",

Your tasks are to analyze the problem, design a feasible algorithm, and implement it using Bayesian Optimization.\n## Task Instruction\nYou need to act as a mathematician, computer scientist, and programmer independently.\n\n**as a mathematician speciliazed in optimization**\n- Identify the key characteristics of the problelms relevant to optimization, such as its multi-modality, separability, and the location of its global minimum.\n- Analyze the problem, focusing on the challenges posed by the problems for optimization algorithms. Consider aspects like local optima, ruggedness, and the search space dimensionality.\n\n**as a computer scientist specialized in bayesian optimization**\n- Based on the problem analysis, propose and compare at least three conceptually different Bayesian Optimization strategies to achieve the best performance on the given problems.\n- You can choose from less complex and more widely applicable approaches(low aggressiveness), or more advanced and specialized techniques(high aggressiveness) tailored to the specific challenges of the problem. Banlance the trade-offs between reward and risk based on AGGRESSIVENESS (0.0-1.0):0.80 \n- Review your choices and design a specific Bayesian Optimization algorithm:\n- Sampling Strategy: Briefly compare popular strategies. Then, explore and justify the selection of a potentially more advanced or specialized sampling technique relevant to the problems' characteristics, such as a quasi-Monte Carlo method with desirable discrepancy properties or a sequential design strategy tailored for exploration.\n- The budget will be provided as a hyperparameter. Choose a strategy to balance n_initial_points and n_iterations. The total number of evaluations should not exceed the budget.\n- Surrogate Model: Briefly compare the standard Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) with common kernels. Then, investigate and justify the choice of a potentially more advanced or specialized surrogate model. Explain the potential advantages of this choice over standard GPR.\n- Choose a metric to evaluate the model, e.g., negative log-likelihood, or other relevant metrics. Justify your choice.\n- Acquisition Function: Briefly compare standard acquisition functions. Then, consider and justify the selection of a potentially more innovative acquisition function designed to handle multi-modality or improve exploration efficiency, such as Thompson Sampling, Information Gain-based approaches, or those incorporating risk or regret considerations. Explain the rationale behind your choice.\n- Choose the promising hyperparameters for the acquisition function, surrogate model, and other components.\n- Other Possible Techniques: Discuss the potential benefits of incorporating cutting-edge techniques within the Bayesian Optimization framework for this specific problem. Explain how these techniques could address the identified challenges.\n- Pseudocode: Write down the detailed steps of your chosen Bayesian Optimization algorithm in plain pseudocode, highlighting any novel components or adaptations.\n\n**as a programmer specialized in python**\n- Name the algorithm using a descriptive name that reflects the chosen components, potentially highlighting the novel aspect of the algorithm.\n- Implement the algorithm in Python strictly following the provided code structure guide. Ensure that the implementation aligns with the pseudocode developed in the previous step, paying particular attention to the implementation of any novel methods.\n- Code Implementation only contain the algorithm class. No usage examples\n- You are allowed to use numpy, scipy, scikit-learn, Gpy, torch, gpytorch and botorch.\n- Use other libraries only if they can not be repalced by the above libraries. \n\n## Problem Description\nShekel synthtetic test function.\n\n    4-dimensional function (usually evaluated on `[0, 10]^4`):\n\n        f(x) = -sum_{i=1}^10 (sum_{j=1}^4 (x_j - A_{ji})^2 + C_i)^{-1}\n\n    f has one minimizer for its global minimum at `z_1 = (4, 4, 4, 4)` with\n    `f(z_1) = -10.5363`.\n    \ndimensions:4, Bounds: (array([0., 0., 0., 0.]), array([10., 10., 10., 10.]))\n## Code Structure Guide\n```python\nfrom typing import Callable\nfrom scipy.stats import qmc # If you are using QMC sampling.
