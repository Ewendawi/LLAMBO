Your tasks are to analyze the problem, design a feasible algorithm, and implement it using Bayesian Optimization.\n## Task Instruction\nYou need to act as a mathematician, computer scientist, and programmer independently.\n\n**as a mathematician speciliazed in optimization**\n- Identify the key characteristics of the problelms relevant to optimization, such as its multi-modality, separability, and the location of its global minimum.\n- Analyze the problem, focusing on the challenges posed by the problems for optimization algorithms. Consider aspects like local optima, ruggedness, and the search space dimensionality.\n\n**as a computer scientist specialized in bayesian optimization**\n- Based on the problem analysis, propose and compare at least three conceptually different Bayesian Optimization strategies to achieve the best performance on the given problems.\n- You can choose from less complex and more widely applicable approaches(low aggressiveness), or more advanced and specialized techniques(high aggressiveness) tailored to the specific challenges of the problem. Banlance the trade-offs between reward and risk based on AGGRESSIVENESS (0.0-1.0):0.80 \n- Review your choices and design a specific Bayesian Optimization algorithm:\n- Sampling Strategy: Briefly compare popular strategies. Then, explore and justify the selection of a potentially more advanced or specialized sampling technique relevant to the problems' characteristics, such as a quasi-Monte Carlo method with desirable discrepancy properties or a sequential design strategy tailored for exploration.\n- The budget will be provided as a hyperparameter. Choose a strategy to balance n_initial_points and n_iterations. The total number of evaluations should not exceed the budget.\n- Surrogate Model: Briefly compare the standard Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) with common kernels. Then, investigate and justify the choice of a potentially more advanced or specialized surrogate model. Explain the potential advantages of this choice over standard GPR.\n- Choose a metric to evaluate the model, e.g., negative log-likelihood, or other relevant metrics. Justify your choice.\n- Acquisition Function: Briefly compare standard acquisition functions. Then, consider and justify the selection of a potentially more innovative acquisition function designed to handle multi-modality or improve exploration efficiency, such as Thompson Sampling, Information Gain-based approaches, or those incorporating risk or regret considerations. Explain the rationale behind your choice.\n- Choose the promising hyperparameters for the acquisition function, surrogate model, and other components.\n- Other Possible Techniques: Discuss the potential benefits of incorporating cutting-edge techniques within the Bayesian Optimization framework for this specific problem. Explain how these techniques could address the identified challenges.\n- Pseudocode: Write down the detailed steps of your chosen Bayesian Optimization algorithm in plain pseudocode, highlighting any novel components or adaptations.\n\n**as a programmer specialized in python**\n- Name the algorithm using a descriptive name that reflects the chosen components, potentially highlighting the novel aspect of the algorithm.\n- Implement the algorithm in Python strictly following the provided code structure guide. Ensure that the implementation aligns with the pseudocode developed in the previous step, paying particular attention to the implementation of any novel methods.\n- Code Implementation only contain the algorithm class. No usage examples\n- You are allowed to use numpy, scipy, scikit-learn, Gpy, torch, gpytorch and botorch.\n- Use other libraries only if they can not be repalced by the above libraries. \n\n## Problem Description\nAckley test function.\n\n    d-dimensional function (usually evaluated on `[-32.768, 32.768]^d`):\n\n        f(x) = -A exp(-B sqrt(1/d sum_{i=1}^d x_i^2)) -\n            exp(1/d sum_{i=1}^d cos(c x_i)) + A + exp(1)\n\n    f has one minimizer for its global minimum at `z_1 = (0, 0, ..., 0)` with\n    `f(z_1) = 0`.\n    \ndimensions:6, Bounds: (array([-32.768, -32.768, -32.768, -32.768, -32.768, -32.768]), array([32.768, 32.768, 32.768, 32.768, 32.768, 32.768]))\n## Code Structure Guide\n```python\nfrom typing import Callable\nfrom scipy.stats import qmc # If you are using QMC sampling.

We will use a strategy of 10 initial points and 90 iterations.\n\nThe proposed algorithm is called \"AckleyBO\".\n\n### /Description\n\n### Code\n```python\nfrom typing import Callable\nfrom scipy.stats import qmc\nimport numpy as np\nfrom botorch.acquisition import ExpectedImprovement\nfrom botorch.models import SingleTaskGP\nfrom botorch.fit import fit_gpytorch_model\nfrom gpytorch.mlls import ExactMarginalLogLikelihood\nfrom gpytorch.kernels import MaternKernel\nfrom gpytorch.priors import NormalPrior\n\nclass AckleyBO:\n    def __init__(self):\n        # Initialize optimizer settings\n        self.n_initial_points = 10\n        self.n_iterations = None\n        self.bounds = None\n        self.objective_fn = None\n        self.model = None\n        self.acquisition_function = None\n        self.model_losses = []\n\n    def _sample_points(self, n_points):\n        # sample points using quasi-Monte Carlo method\n        sampler = qmc.Halton(d=6, scramble=False)\n        points = sampler.random(n=n_points)\n        points = points * (self.bounds[1] - self.bounds[0]) + self.bounds[0]\n        return points\n\n    def _fit_model(self, X, y):\n        # Fit and tune surrogate model\n        self.model = SingleTaskGP(train_inputs=(X, y))\n        self.model.covar_module = MaternKernel()\n        mll = ExactMarginalLogLikelihood(self.model.likelihood, self.model)\n        fit_gpytorch_model(mll)\n        return self.model\n\n    def _acquisition_function(self, X):\n        # Implement acquisition function\n        self.acquisition_function = ExpectedImprovement(model=self.model, best_f=self.model.train_targets[0].min().item())\n        return self.acquisition_function\n\n    def optimize(self, objective_fn: Callable[[np.ndarray], np.ndarray], bounds: np.ndarray, budget: int) -> tuple[np.ndarray, np.ndarray, tuple[np.ndarray, str], int]:\n        # Main minimize optimization loop\n        self.objective_fn = objective_fn\n        self.bounds = bounds\n        self.n_iterations = budget - self.n_initial_points\n        all_x = []\n        all_y = []\n        model_losses = []\n        for i in range(self.n_iterations + 1):\n            if i == 0:\n                # Sample initial points\n                x = self._sample_points(self.n_initial_points)\n            else:\n                # Sample new point using acquisition function\n                x = self._acquisition_function(x).argmax().unsqueeze(0)\n            # Evaluate objective function\n            y = self.objective_fn(x)\n            all_x.append(x)\n            all_y.append(y)\n            if i > 0:\n                # Update model\n                self.model = self._fit_model(np.concatenate(all_x), np.concatenate(all_y))\n                # Evaluate model loss\n                model_loss = -self.model.log_marginal_likelihood().item()\n                model_losses.append(model_loss)\n        return np.concatenate(all_y), np.concatenate(all_x), (np.array(model_losses), 'log_marginal_likelihood'), self.n_initial_points\n\n```\n### /Code",

This function has a global minimum at `z_1 = (1, 1, ..., 1)` with `f(z_1) = 0`. The function is multi-modal, meaning it has multiple local minima, and its search space dimensionality is 6. The bounds for each dimension are `[-10, 10]`. The challenges posed by this problem include the presence of local optima and the ruggedness of the function.\n\n#### Algorithm Design\nTo address these challenges, we will use a Bayesian Optimization (BO) approach. BO is a powerful tool for global optimization problems, especially when the objective function is expensive to evaluate. We will compare three different BO strategies:\n\n1.  **Standard Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) with Expected Improvement (EI) acquisition function**: This is a widely used and well-established approach in BO. However, it may not be the best choice for this problem due to its simplicity and potential to get stuck in local optima.\n2.  **GPR with Thompson Sampling acquisition function**: Thompson Sampling is a more advanced acquisition function that can handle multi-modality and improve exploration efficiency. It is a good choice for this problem, but it may require more computational resources.\n3.  **GPR with Information Gain-based acquisition function**: This approach is more innovative and can handle multi-modality and improve exploration efficiency. However, it may require more computational resources and expertise to implement.\n\nWe will choose the second approach, GPR with Thompson Sampling acquisition function, as it provides a good balance between exploration and exploitation. For the surrogate model, we will use a standard GPR with a Matern kernel, which is a good choice for multi-modal functions. We will use the negative log-likelihood as the metric to evaluate the model.\n\nFor the sampling strategy, we will use a quasi-Monte Carlo method with a Sobol sequence, which has desirable discrepancy properties. We will choose `n_initial_points` as 10 and `n_iterations` as `budget - n_initial_points`. We will use a budget of 100 evaluations.",

Justify your choice.\n- Acquisition Function: Briefly compare standard acquisition functions. Then, consider and justify the selection of a potentially more innovative acquisition function designed to handle multi-modality or improve exploration efficiency, such as Thompson Sampling, Information Gain-based approaches, or those incorporating risk or regret considerations.

            "description": "### Problem Analysis\nThe Beale function is a two-dimensional, multimodal function known for its sharp peaks and valleys, making it a challenging benchmark for optimization algorithms. Its global minimum is located at (3, 0.5), with a function value of 0. The presence of multiple local minima can easily trap gradient-based algorithms, and the steep gradients in the vicinity of the global minimum require algorithms to be robust and adaptive. The function has a relatively small search space, but its ruggedness makes it difficult for algorithms to explore efficiently, especially when the initial sampling is not close to the global minimum. The separability of the function is not evident, which means that optimizing along each dimension separately won't lead to a satisfactory solution. The major challenges for optimization algorithms are:\n1.  **Multimodality:** The presence of multiple local minima. It requires a good balance between exploration and exploitation to avoid getting stuck in a local minima.\n2.  **Ruggedness:** The sharp peaks and valleys, which can cause difficulties for algorithms that rely on smooth gradients.\n3.  **Global Minimum Location:** The global minimum is relatively isolated, thus requiring an algorithm to find it within a limited budget.\n4.  **Low Dimensionality:** While the problem is 2D, the ruggedness of the function makes it a challenging benchmark for Bayesian Optimization.\n\n### Algorithm Design\nGiven the challenges posed by the Beale function, a robust Bayesian Optimization (BO) strategy is needed. The algorithm will focus on efficient exploration to identify the promising regions and then exploit these regions to locate the global minimum.\n\n**Bayesian Optimization Strategies**\n1.  **Standard BO with GP and Expected Improvement:** This is a common approach, using Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) as the surrogate model and Expected Improvement (EI) as the acquisition function. It is a good baseline and provides a good balance between exploration and exploitation. This is a low aggressiveness approach.\n2.  **BO with Local Penalization and Multi-start:** This approach aims to address multimodality by penalizing regions that have already been explored. After a number of iterations, the algorithm will also restart with a new random initilization to escape any local minima that it may have been trapped in. This approach has intermediate aggressiveness.\n3.  **BO with Deep Kernel Learning and Thompson Sampling:** This is a more advanced approach that uses a deep neural network to learn a more flexible kernel for the surrogate model, enabling it to capture the complex function landscape better. Thompson Sampling (TS) is used as the acquisition function, which is known for its efficient exploration properties, leading to high aggressiveness.\n\nConsidering the balance between reward and risk based on 0.80 aggressiveness, we will choose the third option: **BO with Deep Kernel Learning and Thompson Sampling**.\n\n**Review and Specific Algorithm Design**\n1.  **Sampling Strategy**:\n    - We will use a **Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS)** strategy for the initial points. LHS provides good space-filling properties, ensuring a diverse initial sample.\n    - For the subsequent iterations, the acquisition function (Thompson Sampling) will guide the sampling, which is an adaptive and sequential design strategy.\n\n2.  **Budget Allocation**:\n    - The total budget will be split between initial sampling and iterations by setting `n_initial_points = int(budget * 0.2)` and `n_iterations = budget - n_initial_points`. This will ensure a good initial exploration while allowing for enough iterations to refine the search.\n\n3.  **Surrogate Model**:\n    - Instead of standard GPR with common kernels, we will use a **Deep Kernel Learning (DKL)** model. DKL uses a neural network to learn a more flexible kernel, allowing the surrogate model to capture the complex landscape of the Beale function more accurately, especially the sharp peaks and valleys. This should provide better predictive accuracy than standard GPR.\n    - We will use a neural network with two hidden layers with 10 neurons each. Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) as its activation function.\n    - The DKL model will be trained by minimizing the negative log-likelihood(NLL) of the observed data.\n\n4.  **Evaluation Metric**:\n    - We will use the **negative log-likelihood (NLL)** as the metric to evaluate the model. NLL is a proper scoring rule and a commonly used metric for probabilistic models like the GPR, and it can help to avoid overfitting to the data.\n\n5.  **Acquisition Function**:\n    - Instead of standard acquisition functions, we will use **Thompson Sampling (TS)**. TS is a probabilistic approach that samples from the posterior distribution of the objective function. It is known for its good exploration properties and is well-suited for multimodal functions, as it encourages the algorithm to explore regions with high uncertainty.\n\n6.  **Hyperparameters**:\n    - For DKL, the learning rate is 0.01 and the number of epochs is 100.\n    - For Thompson Sampling, no additional hyperparameters are required.\n\n7.  **Other Techniques**:\n    - **Early Stopping:** We will monitor the NLL during model training and stop training early if the validation loss does not improve for several epochs. This will prevent the model from overfitting and can save computational time.\n\n8.  **Pseudocode**:\n    ```\n    Algorithm: DeepKernelThompsonBO\n    Input: objective_fn, bounds, budget\n\n    1.

            "description": "#### Problem Analysis\nThe Eggholder function is a highly multimodal, non-convex function with numerous local minima, making it a challenging benchmark for optimization algorithms. Its landscape is characterized by deep, narrow valleys and steep ridges, making it prone to getting trapped in local optima. The global minimum is relatively difficult to locate due to the function's oscillatory behavior and the wide search space of `[-512, 512]^2`. Separability is not present in this function, meaning that the dimensions are highly correlated and must be optimized together. The function's global minimum is approximately at `(512, 404.2319)`, with a value of `-959.6407`.\n\nThe challenges for optimization algorithms stem from the function's multi-modality and ruggedness. Gradient-based methods can easily get stuck in local minima. Global optimization techniques are required to explore the search space effectively and converge towards the global optimum. The relatively high dimensionality (2D) compared to simpler problems, while not extremely high, still complicates the search. The function has a lot of local optima, and the algorithm needs to balance exploration and exploitation well to avoid getting stuck in a suboptimal solution.\n\n#### Algorithm Design\nGiven the analysis of the Eggholder function, we need a Bayesian Optimization (BO) strategy that can handle the multi-modality and rugged landscape effectively. We'll aim for a balance between exploration and exploitation, using an aggressive approach that leans towards exploration initially, and then becomes more focused as we gather more data. Here's a breakdown of our choices:\n\n**BO Strategies Comparison:**\n\n1.  **Standard Gaussian Process (GP) BO with Expected Improvement (EI):** This is a common starting point. It uses a Gaussian Process to model the objective function and EI to guide the search. It can be effective for smooth functions, but might struggle with the multi-modality of the Eggholder function and converges slowly. (Low Aggressiveness)\n2.  **GP BO with Thompson Sampling (TS):** Thompson Sampling is a probabilistic acquisition function that samples from the posterior distribution of the GP. This approach can encourage more exploration and handle multimodality better than EI. (Medium Aggressiveness)\n3.  **Deep Gaussian Process (DGP) BO with Thompson Sampling and QMC Sampling:** This is a more advanced approach. We use a Deep Gaussian Process (DGP) as a surrogate model, which can capture more complex relationships in the data than a standard GP. We use Thompson sampling for the acquisition function to encourage exploration while also using quasi-Monte Carlo sampling to improve the initial coverage of the search space. (High Aggressiveness)\n\n**Chosen Strategy:**\n\nWe will implement the **DGP BO with Thompson Sampling and QMC Sampling** strategy, aiming for high aggressiveness to handle the challenges posed by the Eggholder function.\n\n**Specific Algorithm Design:**\n\n*   **Sampling Strategy:**\n    *   **Comparison:** Simple random sampling is easy to implement but may not provide uniform coverage, especially in the initial phase. Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) is better than random sampling but still might miss some regions. Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods like Sobol sequences offer superior space-filling properties and low discrepancy, which can improve the initial coverage of the search space.\n    *   **Choice:** We will employ Sobol sequences for generating the initial points, which is a type of QMC method. We will generate the initial points using Sobol sequences to ensure the initial points are well-distributed across the search space. We chose Sobol sequences because they offer better space-filling properties compared to simple random or LHS. For the subsequent iterations, we will rely on the Thompson Sampling for exploration.\n*   **Budget Allocation:**\n    *   We will allocate 10% of the total budget to the initial points and use the rest for iterations. In the case of a budget of 100, this means that we will use 10 initial points and 90 iterations.\n*   **Surrogate Model:**\n    *   **Comparison:** Standard Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) with common kernels (e.g., RBF, Matern) is a common choice. However, it might struggle with the complex, non-stationary nature of the Eggholder function. Deep Gaussian Processes (DGPs) can model more complex relationships and are more flexible and can handle non-stationarity better.\n    *   **Choice:** We will use a Deep Gaussian Process (DGP) as our surrogate model, which is a hierarchical extension of the GP. DGPs can capture more complex dependencies and are more flexible than standard GPs. We will use a two-layer DGP with RBF kernel and optimize the hyperparameters during the fitting process.\n    *   **Metric:** We will use negative log-likelihood (NLL) as the metric to evaluate the model fit. NLL is a common metric for evaluating the fit of probabilistic models like GPs and DGPs.\n*   **Acquisition Function:**\n    *   **Comparison:** Expected Improvement (EI) is a common choice, but it can be prone to get stuck in local optima. Probability of Improvement (PI) is similar to EI but can be less effective. Thompson Sampling (TS) is a probabilistic approach that samples from the posterior predictive distribution and it encourages better exploration.\n    *   **Choice:** We will use Thompson Sampling (TS) as our acquisition function, which is a probabilistic approach that encourages exploration by sampling from the posterior distribution of the surrogate model. This is particularly useful for multimodal functions.\n*   **Hyperparameters:**\n    *   We will use a two-layer DGP with an RBF kernel. The hyperparameters of the DGP will be optimized during the fitting process.\n    *   We will not have any hyperparameters for Thompson Sampling.\n*   **Other Possible Techniques:**\n    *   **Adaptive Kernel Learning:** We could explore adaptive kernel learning techniques where the kernel parameters are updated based on the current data. This can be useful for dealing with non-stationary functions.\n    *   **Parallel Bayesian Optimization:** We could explore parallel BO techniques to evaluate multiple points simultaneously, thereby speeding up the optimization process, especially when the evaluations are expensive.\n*   **Pseudocode:**\n    ```\n    Algorithm: DeepGP_TS_QMC_BO\n\n    Input: objective_fn, bounds, budget\n    Output: all_y, all_x, model_losses, n_initial_points\n\n    1.

            "description": "#### Problem Analysis\nThe Rosenbrock synthetic test function is a multimodal, non-convex optimization problem with a single global minimum. It is a challenging problem due to its rugged landscape, many local optima, and high dimensionality. The function has a global minimum at `z_1 = (1, 1, ..., 1)` with `f(z_i) = 0.0`. The key characteristics of this problem relevant to optimization are its multi-modality, non-separability, and the location of its global minimum.\n\nThe challenges posed by this problem for optimization algorithms include:\n\n*   **Local optima**: The function has many local optima, which can trap optimization algorithms and prevent them from finding the global minimum.\n*   **Ruggedness**: The function's landscape is rugged, with many peaks and valleys, making it difficult for optimization algorithms to navigate.\n*   **High dimensionality**: The function is defined in a high-dimensional space (6 dimensions), which increases the complexity of the optimization problem.\n\n#### Algorithm Design\nTo tackle the Rosenbrock synthetic test function, we propose a Bayesian Optimization (BO) algorithm with the following components:\n\n*   **Sampling Strategy**: We will use a quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) method with a Halton sequence to sample the initial points. QMC methods are known for their ability to efficiently explore high-dimensional spaces.\n*   **Surrogate Model**: We will use a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model with a Matern kernel to model the objective function. The Matern kernel is a flexible kernel that can handle both smooth and rough functions.\n*   **Acquisition Function**: We will use the Expected Improvement (EI) acquisition function, which balances exploration and exploitation. EI is a popular choice for BO because it is easy to implement and provides a good trade-off between exploration and exploitation.\n*   **Budget Allocation**: We will allocate the budget by setting `n_initial_points` to 10 and `n_iterations` to `budget - n_initial_points`. This allows us to explore the space efficiently while also having enough iterations to refine the search.",

Your tasks are to analyze the problem, design a feasible algorithm, and implement it using Bayesian Optimization.\n## Task Instruction\nYou need to act as a mathematician, computer scientist, and programmer independently.\n\n**as a mathematician speciliazed in optimization**\n- Identify the key characteristics of the problelms relevant to optimization, such as its multi-modality, separability, and the location of its global minimum.\n- Analyze the problem, focusing on the challenges posed by the problems for optimization algorithms. Consider aspects like local optima, ruggedness, and the search space dimensionality.\n\n**as a computer scientist specialized in bayesian optimization**\n- Based on the problem analysis, propose and compare at least three conceptually different Bayesian Optimization strategies to achieve the best performance on the given problems.\n- You can choose from less complex and more widely applicable approaches(low aggressiveness), or more advanced and specialized techniques(high aggressiveness) tailored to the specific challenges of the problem. Banlance the trade-offs between reward and risk based on AGGRESSIVENESS (0.0-1.0):0.80 \n- Review your choices and design a specific Bayesian Optimization algorithm:\n- Sampling Strategy: Briefly compare popular strategies. Then, explore and justify the selection of a potentially more advanced or specialized sampling technique relevant to the problems' characteristics, such as a quasi-Monte Carlo method with desirable discrepancy properties or a sequential design strategy tailored for exploration.\n- The budget will be provided as a hyperparameter. Choose a strategy to balance n_initial_points and n_iterations. The total number of evaluations should not exceed the budget.\n- Surrogate Model: Briefly compare the standard Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) with common kernels. Then, investigate and justify the choice of a potentially more advanced or specialized surrogate model. Explain the potential advantages of this choice over standard GPR.\n- Choose a metric to evaluate the model, e.g., negative log-likelihood, or other relevant metrics. Justify your choice.\n- Acquisition Function: Briefly compare standard acquisition functions. Then, consider and justify the selection of a potentially more innovative acquisition function designed to handle multi-modality or improve exploration efficiency, such as Thompson Sampling, Information Gain-based approaches, or those incorporating risk or regret considerations. Explain the rationale behind your choice.\n- Choose the promising hyperparameters for the acquisition function, surrogate model, and other components.\n- Other Possible Techniques: Discuss the potential benefits of incorporating cutting-edge techniques within the Bayesian Optimization framework for this specific problem. Explain how these techniques could address the identified challenges.\n- Pseudocode: Write down the detailed steps of your chosen Bayesian Optimization algorithm in plain pseudocode, highlighting any novel components or adaptations.\n\n**as a programmer specialized in python**\n- Name the algorithm using a descriptive name that reflects the chosen components, potentially highlighting the novel aspect of the algorithm.\n- Implement the algorithm in Python strictly following the provided code structure guide. Ensure that the implementation aligns with the pseudocode developed in the previous step, paying particular attention to the implementation of any novel methods.\n- Code Implementation only contain the algorithm class. No usage examples\n- You are allowed to use numpy, scipy, scikit-learn, Gpy, torch, gpytorch and botorch.\n- Use other libraries only if they can not be repalced by the above libraries. \n\n## Problem Description\nRosenbrock synthetic test function.\n\n    d-dimensional function (usually evaluated on `[-5, 10]^d`):\n\n        f(x) = sum_{i=1}^{d-1} (100 (x_{i+1} - x_i^2)^2 + (x_i - 1)^2)\n\n    f has one minimizer for its global minimum at `z_1 = (1, 1, ..., 1)` with\n    `f(z_i) = 0.0`.\n    \ndimensions:6, Bounds: (array([-5., -5., -5., -5., -5., -5.]), array([10., 10., 10., 10., 10., 10.]))\n## Code Structure Guide\n```python\nfrom typing import Callable\nfrom scipy.stats import qmc # If you are using QMC sampling.

Your tasks are to analyze the problem, design a feasible algorithm, and implement it using Bayesian Optimization.\n## Task Instruction\nYou need to act as a mathematician, computer scientist, and programmer independently.\n\n**as a mathematician speciliazed in optimization**\n- Identify the key characteristics of the problelms relevant to optimization, such as its multi-modality, separability, and the location of its global minimum.\n- Analyze the problem, focusing on the challenges posed by the problems for optimization algorithms. Consider aspects like local optima, ruggedness, and the search space dimensionality.\n\n**as a computer scientist specialized in bayesian optimization**\n- Based on the problem analysis, propose and compare at least three conceptually different Bayesian Optimization strategies to achieve the best performance on the given problems.\n- You can choose from less complex and more widely applicable approaches(low aggressiveness), or more advanced and specialized techniques(high aggressiveness) tailored to the specific challenges of the problem. Banlance the trade-offs between reward and risk based on AGGRESSIVENESS (0.0-1.0):0.80 \n- Review your choices and design a specific Bayesian Optimization algorithm:\n- Sampling Strategy: Briefly compare popular strategies. Then, explore and justify the selection of a potentially more advanced or specialized sampling technique relevant to the problems' characteristics, such as a quasi-Monte Carlo method with desirable discrepancy properties or a sequential design strategy tailored for exploration.\n- The budget will be provided as a hyperparameter. Choose a strategy to balance n_initial_points and n_iterations. The total number of evaluations should not exceed the budget.\n- Surrogate Model: Briefly compare the standard Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) with common kernels.

Explain the potential advantages of this choice over standard GPR.\n- Choose a metric to evaluate the model, e.g., negative log-likelihood, or other relevant metrics. Justify your choice.\n- Acquisition Function: Briefly compare standard acquisition functions. Then, consider and justify the selection of a potentially more innovative acquisition function designed to handle multi-modality or improve exploration efficiency, such as Thompson Sampling, Information Gain-based approaches, or those incorporating risk or regret considerations. Explain the rationale behind your choice.\n- Choose the promising hyperparameters for the acquisition function, surrogate model, and other components.\n- Other Possible Techniques: Discuss the potential benefits of incorporating cutting-edge techniques within the Bayesian Optimization framework for this specific problem. Explain how these techniques could address the identified challenges.\n- Pseudocode: Write down the detailed steps of your chosen Bayesian Optimization algorithm in plain pseudocode, highlighting any novel components or adaptations.\n\n**as a programmer specialized in python**\n- Name the algorithm using a descriptive name that reflects the chosen components, potentially highlighting the novel aspect of the algorithm.\n- Implement the algorithm in Python strictly following the provided code structure guide. Ensure that the implementation aligns with the pseudocode developed in the previous step, paying particular attention to the implementation of any novel methods.\n- Code Implementation only contain the algorithm class.

The function has multiple local optima, making it challenging for optimization algorithms. \n\nAs a mathematician, the key characteristics of this problem are its multi-modality and the presence of local optima. The function is not separable, and its search space dimensionality is moderate (4 dimensions). \n\nAs a computer scientist, we will design a Bayesian Optimization algorithm to tackle this problem. We will compare three conceptually different strategies: \n1. A standard Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) with a Matern kernel and Expected Improvement (EI) acquisition function.\n2. A more advanced approach using a quasi-Monte Carlo method for sampling and a Tree-structured Parzen Estimator Density (TPE) as the surrogate model.\n3. A high-aggressiveness approach using a sequential design strategy and a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) as the surrogate model.\n\nWe will balance the trade-offs between reward and risk based on aggressiveness (0.0-1.0): 0.40. \n\nThe chosen algorithm will be a combination of the second and third approaches. We will use a quasi-Monte Carlo method for sampling, a TPE as the surrogate model, and a sequential design strategy tailored for exploration. The acquisition function will be a combination of EI and Thompson Sampling to handle exploration-exploitation trade-offs.\n\nThe surrogate model will be a TPE, which is more advanced than standard GPR and can handle multi-modality. The metric to evaluate the model will be the negative log-likelihood.\n\n### /Description\n\n### Code\n```python\nfrom typing import Callable\nfrom scipy.stats import qmc\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.gaussian_process import GaussianProcessRegressor\nfrom sklearn.gaussian_process.kernels import Matern\nfrom skopt import gp_minimize\nfrom skopt.space import Real\nfrom skopt.utils import use_named_args\nfrom skopt.acquisition import gaussian_acquisition_1D\n\nclass ShekelBO:\n    def __init__(self):\n        # Initialize optimizer settings\n        self.n_initial_points = 10  # number of initial points\n        self.acquisition_function = 'EI'  # acquisition function\n\n    def _sample_points(self, n_points):\n        # sample points using quasi-Monte Carlo method\n        sampler = qmc.Halton(d=4, scramble=False)\n        points = sampler.random(n=n_points)\n        return points\n\n    def _fit_model(self, X, y):\n        # Fit and tune surrogate model (TPE)\n        from skopt.learning import GradientBoostingQuantileRegressor\n        from skopt.learning import ExtraTreesRegressor\n        model = GradientBoostingQuantileRegressor()\n        model.fit(X, y)\n        return model\n\n    def _acquisition_function(self, X):\n        # Implement acquisition function (EI + Thompson Sampling)\n        from skopt.acquisition import gaussian_acquisition_1D\n        from skopt.acquisition import gaussian_acquisition_2D\n        acquisition_values = []\n        for x in X:\n            acquisition_value = gaussian_acquisition_1D(x, self.model, self.space)\n            acquisition_values.append(acquisition_value)\n        return np.array(acquisition_values)\n\n    def optimize(self, objective_fn: Callable[[np.ndarray], np.ndarray], bounds: np.ndarray, budget: int) -> tuple[np.ndarray, np.ndarray, tuple[np.ndarray, str], int]:\n        # Main minimize optimization loop\n        self.n_iterations = budget - self.n_initial_points\n        self.space = [Real(bounds[0][i], bounds[1][i]) for i in range(4)]\n        X = self._sample_points(self.n_initial_points)\n        y = objective_fn(X)\n        self.model = self._fit_model(X, y)\n        model_losses = []\n        model_loss = -np.mean(y)\n        model_losses.append(model_loss)\n        for _ in range(self.n_iterations):\n            acquisition_values = self._acquisition_function(self._sample_points(100))\n            next_point = self._sample_points(1)[0]\n            next_point = next_point[np.argmax(acquisition_values)]\n            next_y = objective_fn(next_point)\n            X = np.vstack((X, next_point))\n            y = np.vstack((y, next_y))\n            self.model = self._fit_model(X, y)\n            model_loss = -np.mean(y)\n            model_losses.append(model_loss)\n        return y, X, (np.array(model_losses), 'negative_log_likelihood'), self.n_initial_points\n\n```\n\n### /Code",

We will use `GaussianProcessRegressor` from `scikit-learn` to fit the model and `qmc` from `scipy` to sample points.\n\n### /Description\n\n### Code\n```python\nfrom typing import Callable\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.stats import qmc\nfrom sklearn.gaussian_process import GaussianProcessRegressor\nfrom sklearn.gaussian_process.kernels import Matern\n\nclass ShekelBO:\n    def __init__(self):\n        # Initialize optimizer settings\n        self.n_initial_points = 10  # number of initial points\n        self.acquisition_function = 'EI'  # acquisition function\n\n    def _sample_points(self, n_points, bounds):\n        # sample points using quasi-Monte Carlo method\n        sampler = qmc.Halton(d=len(bounds), scramble=False)\n        points = sampler.random(n=n_points)\n        scaled_points = qmc.scale(points, [bounds[i][0] for i in range(len(bounds))], [bounds[i][1] for i in range(len(bounds))])\n        return scaled_points\n\n    def _fit_model(self, X, y):\n        # Fit and tune surrogate model (Gaussian Process)\n        kernel = Matern()\n        model = GaussianProcessRegressor(kernel=kernel)\n        model.fit(X, y)\n        return model\n\n    def _acquisition_function(self, X, model):\n        # Implement acquisition function (EI)\n        from scipy.stats import norm\n        mean, std = model.predict(X, return_std=True)\n        a = (mean - np.max(model.y_train_)) / std\n        acquisition_values = (mean - np.max(model.y_train_)) * norm.cdf(a) + std * norm.pdf(a)\n        return acquisition_values\n\n    def optimize(self, objective_fn: Callable[[np.ndarray], np.ndarray], bounds: np.ndarray, budget: int) -> tuple[np.ndarray, np.ndarray, tuple[np.ndarray, str], int]:\n        # Main minimize optimization loop\n        self.n_iterations = budget - self.n_initial_points\n        X = self._sample_points(self.n_initial_points, bounds)\n        y = objective_fn(X)\n        self.model = self._fit_model(X, y.ravel())\n        model_losses = []\n        model_loss = -np.mean(y)\n        model_losses.append(model_loss)\n        for _ in range(self.n_iterations):\n            new_points = self._sample_points(100, bounds)\n            acquisition_values = self._acquisition_function(new_points, self.model)\n            next_point = new_points[np.argmax(acquisition_values)]\n            next_y = objective_fn(next_point.reshape(1, -1))\n            X = np.vstack((X, next_point))\n            y = np.vstack((y, next_y))\n            self.model = self._fit_model(X, y.ravel())\n            model_loss = -np.mean(y)\n            model_losses.append(model_loss)\n        return y, X, (np.array(model_losses), 'negative_log_likelihood'), self.n_initial_points\n```\n### /Code\n\nNote: I have made some changes to the code to make it work with the given libraries.

The number of initial points will be set to 10, and the number of iterations will be set to `budget - 10`.\n* **Metric**: The negative log-likelihood will be used to evaluate the model.\n\n### /Description\n\n### Code\n```python\nfrom typing import Callable\nfrom scipy.stats import qmc\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.gaussian_process import GaussianProcessRegressor\nfrom sklearn.gaussian_process.kernels import Matern\n\nclass QMCTSOBO:\n    def __init__(self):\n        # Initialize optimizer settings\n        self.n_initial_points = 10\n        self.acquisition_function = 'thompson_sampling'\n        self.surrogate_model = 'gpr'\n        self.kernel = Matern()\n\n    def _sample_points(self, n_points):\n        # QMC sampling with Sobol sequence generator\n        sampler = qmc.Sobol(d=2, scramble=True)\n        points = sampler.random(n=n_points)\n        return points\n\n    def _fit_model(self, X, y):\n        # Fit and tune surrogate model\n        gpr = GaussianProcessRegressor(kernel=self.kernel)\n        gpr.fit(X, y)\n        return gpr\n\n    def _acquisition_function(self, X, gpr):\n        # Thompson sampling with beta distribution\n        beta = np.random.beta(1, 1, size=len(X))\n        mean, std = gpr.predict(X, return_std=True)\n        return mean + beta * std\n\n    def optimize(self, objective_fn: Callable[[np.ndarray], np.ndarray], bounds: np.ndarray, budget: int) -> tuple[np.ndarray, np.ndarray, tuple[np.ndarray, str], int]:\n        # Main minimize optimization loop\n        self.n_iterations = budget - self.n_initial_points\n        all_x = np.zeros((budget, 2))\n        all_y = np.zeros((budget, 1))\n        model_losses = np.zeros((self.n_iterations + 1,))\n        loss_name = 'negative_log_likelihood'\n\n        # Initial points\n        X_init = self._sample_points(self.n_initial_points)\n        y_init = objective_fn(X_init)\n        all_x[:self.n_initial_points] = X_init\n        all_y[:self.n_initial_points] = y_init\n\n        # Fit initial model\n        gpr = self._fit_model(X_init, y_init)\n        model_losses[0] = -gpr.log_marginal_likelihood(gpr.kernel_.theta)\n\n        # Iterations\n        for i in range(self.n_iterations):\n            # Acquisition function\n            X_cand = self._sample_points(100)\n            X_cand = X_cand * (bounds[1] - bounds[0]) + bounds[0]\n            acq_vals = self._acquisition_function(X_cand, gpr)\n\n            # Select next point\n            idx = np.argmax(acq_vals)\n            next_x = X_cand[idx]\n\n            # Evaluate objective function\n            next_y = objective_fn(next_x)\n\n            # Update data\n            all_x[self.n_initial_points + i] = next_x\n            all_y[self.n_initial_points + i] = next_y\n\n            # Update model\n            gpr = self._fit_model(np.vstack((all_x[:self.n_initial_points + i + 1], all_y[:self.n_initial_points + i + 1])), all_y[:self.n_initial_points + i + 1])\n            model_losses[i + 1] = -gpr.log_marginal_likelihood(gpr.kernel_.theta)\n\n        return all_y, all_x, (model_losses, loss_name), self.n_initial_points\n```\n\n### /Code",

            "description": "### Problem Analysis\nThe Michalewicz function is a challenging benchmark problem for optimization algorithms due to its multi-modality, high dimensionality (in this case, 6), and the presence of many local minima. The function's rugged landscape makes it difficult for gradient-based methods to converge to the global minimum. The location of the global minimum is not analytically known, and it is highly dependent on the dimensionality. The separability of the function is low, meaning that changes in one dimension can significantly affect the function value, making it hard to optimize each dimension independently. The given bounds of [0, pi] for each dimension further complicate the search space, as they restrict the search within a relatively narrow range, increasing the risk of being trapped in local optima. The function's sinusoidal nature introduces many flat regions and sharp peaks, demanding robust exploration and exploitation strategies. The 6-dimensional nature of the problem makes it challenging because the search space grows exponentially with the number of dimensions. It requires algorithms to efficiently explore the space and avoid premature convergence to suboptimal solutions.\n\n### Algorithm Design\nGiven the challenging characteristics of the Michalewicz function, a robust Bayesian Optimization strategy is needed. A high level of aggressiveness (0.8) implies a preference for a more advanced approach that balances exploration and exploitation efficiently, even if it involves some risk of over-exploration.\n\n**Comparison of BO Strategies and Choice**\n\n1.  **Standard BO (Low Aggressiveness):** Uses Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) with a standard kernel (e.g., RBF), Expected Improvement (EI) acquisition function, and random initial sampling. This approach is simple and widely applicable but may struggle with the multi-modality of the Michalewicz function, especially in higher dimensions, and may not be aggressive enough for this task.\n2.  **BO with Improved Exploration (Medium Aggressiveness):** Uses GPR with a Mat\u00e9rn kernel, Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) acquisition, and Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) for initial points. The Mat\u00e9rn kernel can better handle non-smooth functions, UCB encourages exploration, and LHS provides better coverage of the search space initially. This approach is more robust but may still not be efficient enough for the complex landscape of the Michalewicz function and may be too conservative.\n3.  **BO with Thompson Sampling and Deep Kernel Learning (High Aggressiveness):** Uses a Deep Kernel Learning (DKL) surrogate model, Thompson Sampling acquisition, and a quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) initial sampling. DKL can capture more complex relationships in the data, Thompson Sampling is known for its good exploration-exploitation balance, and QMC provides a better initial distribution of points. This approach is the most aggressive, aiming to model complex function landscapes and efficiently navigate the search space.\n\n**Chosen Strategy:**\n\nGiven the high aggressiveness (0.8), **BO with Thompson Sampling and Deep Kernel Learning** is the chosen strategy. This strategy is tailored to handle the multi-modality and complex landscape of the Michalewicz function by leveraging the power of deep learning to model the underlying function and using Thompson Sampling for exploration-exploitation.\n**Sampling Strategy:**\n\n*   **Comparison:**\n    *   **Random Sampling:** Simple but can lead to poor space coverage, especially in higher dimensions.\n    *   **Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS):** Provides better coverage than random sampling but might still not be optimal for very complex landscapes.\n    *   **Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) Sampling:** Provides a low-discrepancy sequence, leading to more uniform sampling and better coverage of the search space.\n*   **Choice:** **Sobol sequence QMC sampling** will be used due to its superior space-filling properties compared to random or LHS, making it more suitable for exploring a complex, high-dimensional space like the Michalewicz function.\n\n**Budget Allocation:**\n\n*   A fixed ratio will be used to determine `n_initial_points` and `n_iterations` based on the budget. With a high aggressiveness, a larger initial sample size is preferred. The initial sample size will be 20% of the budget. The remaining evaluations are used for iterations.\n\n**Surrogate Model:**\n\n*   **Comparison:**\n    *   **Gaussian Process Regression (GPR):** A standard choice, but its performance depends on the kernel selection. It may struggle with highly non-linear functions.\n    *   **Deep Kernel Learning (DKL):** Combines the flexibility of neural networks with the probabilistic nature of GP, allowing for a more accurate and powerful representation of complex functions.\n*   **Choice:** **Deep Kernel Learning (DKL)** will be used. DKL uses a neural network to learn a feature map that is then used as input to a Gaussian process. This allows DKL to capture more complex relationships in the data compared to standard GPR, which is especially useful for the rugged landscape of the Michalewicz function. The neural network structure will consist of two hidden layers with 32 and 16 neurons respectively, using ReLU activation function.\n\n**Metric:**\n\n*   **Choice:** **Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL)** will be used to evaluate the model. NLL is a good measure of how well the probabilistic model (DKL) fits the data. Minimizing NLL encourages the model to assign high probabilities to observed data points, thus improving the model's predictive ability.\n\n**Acquisition Function:**\n\n*   **Comparison:**\n    *   **Expected Improvement (EI):** Balances exploration and exploitation but can be prone to getting stuck in local optima.\n    *   **Upper Confidence Bound (UCB):** Encourages exploration but may be too conservative for multimodal problems.\n    *   **Thompson Sampling (TS):** Uses posterior sampling for exploration and exploitation, known for its robustness and effectiveness in various scenarios, especially when the uncertainty is well modeled.\n*   **Choice:** **Thompson Sampling (TS)** is chosen. TS draws samples from the posterior distribution of the surrogate model and selects the next point to evaluate based on the sample that minimizes the objective function. This approach is particularly effective for multimodal functions because it naturally explores regions with high uncertainty while also exploiting promising areas.\n\n**Hyperparameters:**\n\n*   **DKL:** The neural network will have two hidden layers (32 and 16 neurons) and ReLU activation functions. The base GP will use a RBF kernel.\n*   **QMC:** Use Sobol sequence.\n*   **Thompson Sampling:** No additional hyperparameters are needed.\n\n**Other Possible Techniques:**\n\n*   **Multi-start optimization:** After the Bayesian optimization, local optimization can be performed using the best points found.\n*   **Batch Bayesian Optimization:** Instead of selecting one point at a time, select a batch of points to evaluate in parallel.\n*   **Adaptive Kernels:** Kernels can be adapted during the optimization process to reflect the local structure of the objective function.\n\n**Pseudocode:**\n\n```\nAlgorithm: ThompsonSamplingDKL_BO\n\n1.  Initialize:\n    - Define objective function `objective_fn`, bounds, and budget.\n    - Set `n_initial_points` to 20% of the budget.\n    - Set `n_iterations` to budget - `n_initial_points`.\n    - Generate `n_initial_points` using Sobol sequence QMC sampling within the bounds.\n    - Evaluate the initial points using `objective_fn`.\n    - Initialize `all_x` with the initial points and `all_y` with the corresponding objective function values.\n    - Initialize an empty list `model_losses`.\n\n2.  Fit Initial Model:\n    - Fit the DKL surrogate model to the initial data (X, y).\n    - Evaluate the model using Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL) metric and append it to `model_losses`.\n\n3.  For i = 1 to `n_iterations`:\n    -  Draw a sample from the posterior distribution of the DKL model at a set of candidate points (e.g., generated randomly or using QMC)\n    - Evaluate the sample and find the point that minimizes the sampled function value.\n    - Evaluate the objective function at selected point.\n    - Append the selected point to `all_x` and the objective value to `all_y`.\n    - Fit the DKL surrogate model using the updated data (all_x, all_y).\n    - Evaluate the model using NLL and append the loss to `model_losses`.\n\n4.  Return:\n    - Return `all_y`, `all_x`, `model_losses`, and `n_initial_points`.\n```",

The function's rugged landscape makes it difficult for gradient-based methods to converge to the global minimum. The location of the global minimum is not analytically known, and it is highly dependent on the dimensionality. The separability of the function is low, meaning that changes in one dimension can significantly affect the function value, making it hard to optimize each dimension independently. The given bounds of [0, pi] for each dimension further complicate the search space, as they restrict the search within a relatively narrow range, increasing the risk of being trapped in local optima. The function's sinusoidal nature introduces many flat regions and sharp peaks, demanding robust exploration and exploitation strategies. The 6-dimensional nature of the problem makes it challenging because the search space grows exponentially with the number of dimensions. It requires algorithms to efficiently explore the space and avoid premature convergence to suboptimal solutions.\n\n### Algorithm Design\nGiven the challenging characteristics of the Michalewicz function, a robust Bayesian Optimization strategy is needed. A high level of aggressiveness (0.8) implies a preference for a more advanced approach that balances exploration and exploitation efficiently, even if it involves some risk of over-exploration.\n\n**Comparison of BO Strategies and Choice**\n\n1.  **Standard BO (Low Aggressiveness):** Uses Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) with a standard kernel (e.g., RBF), Expected Improvement (EI) acquisition function, and random initial sampling. This approach is simple and widely applicable but may struggle with the multi-modality of the Michalewicz function, especially in higher dimensions, and may not be aggressive enough for this task.\n2.  **BO with Improved Exploration (Medium Aggressiveness):** Uses GPR with a Mat\u00e9rn kernel, Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) acquisition, and Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) for initial points. The Mat\u00e9rn kernel can better handle non-smooth functions, UCB encourages exploration, and LHS provides better coverage of the search space initially. This approach is more robust but may still not be efficient enough for the complex landscape of the Michalewicz function and may be too conservative.\n3.  **BO with Thompson Sampling and Deep Kernel Learning (High Aggressiveness):** Uses a Deep Kernel Learning (DKL) surrogate model, Thompson Sampling acquisition, and a quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) initial sampling. DKL can capture more complex relationships in the data, Thompson Sampling is known for its good exploration-exploitation balance, and QMC provides a better initial distribution of points. This approach is the most aggressive, aiming to model complex function landscapes and efficiently navigate the search space.\n\n**Chosen Strategy:**\n\nGiven the high aggressiveness (0.8), **BO with Thompson Sampling and Deep Kernel Learning** is the chosen strategy. This strategy is tailored to handle the multi-modality and complex landscape of the Michalewicz function by leveraging the power of deep learning to model the underlying function and using Thompson Sampling for exploration-exploitation.\n**Sampling Strategy:**\n\n*   **Comparison:**\n    *   **Random Sampling:** Simple but can lead to poor space coverage, especially in higher dimensions.\n    *   **Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS):** Provides better coverage than random sampling but might still not be optimal for very complex landscapes.\n    *   **Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) Sampling:** Provides a low-discrepancy sequence, leading to more uniform sampling and better coverage of the search space.\n*   **Choice:** **Sobol sequence QMC sampling** will be used due to its superior space-filling properties compared to random or LHS, making it more suitable for exploring a complex, high-dimensional space like the Michalewicz function.\n\n**Budget Allocation:**\n\n*   A fixed ratio will be used to determine `n_initial_points` and `n_iterations` based on the budget. With a high aggressiveness, a larger initial sample size is preferred. The initial sample size will be 20% of the budget. The remaining evaluations are used for iterations.\n\n**Surrogate Model:**\n\n*   **Comparison:**\n    *   **Gaussian Process Regression (GPR):** A standard choice, but its performance depends on the kernel selection. It may struggle with highly non-linear functions.\n    *   **Deep Kernel Learning (DKL):** Combines the flexibility of neural networks with the probabilistic nature of GP, allowing for a more accurate and powerful representation of complex functions.\n*   **Choice:** **Deep Kernel Learning (DKL)** will be used. DKL uses a neural network to learn a feature map that is then used as input to a Gaussian process. This allows DKL to capture more complex relationships in the data compared to standard GPR, which is especially useful for the rugged landscape of the Michalewicz function. The neural network structure will consist of two hidden layers with 32 and 16 neurons respectively, using ReLU activation function.\n\n**Metric:**\n\n*   **Choice:** **Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL)** will be used to evaluate the model. NLL is a good measure of how well the probabilistic model (DKL) fits the data. Minimizing NLL encourages the model to assign high probabilities to observed data points, thus improving the model's predictive ability.\n\n**Acquisition Function:**\n\n*   **Comparison:**\n    *   **Expected Improvement (EI):** Balances exploration and exploitation but can be prone to getting stuck in local optima.\n    *   **Upper Confidence Bound (UCB):** Encourages exploration but may be too conservative for multimodal problems.\n    *   **Thompson Sampling (TS):** Uses posterior sampling for exploration and exploitation, known for its robustness and effectiveness in various scenarios, especially when the uncertainty is well modeled.\n*   **Choice:** **Thompson Sampling (TS)** is chosen. TS draws samples from the posterior distribution of the surrogate model and selects the next point to evaluate based on the sample that minimizes the objective function. This approach is particularly effective for multimodal functions because it naturally explores regions with high uncertainty while also exploiting promising areas.\n\n**Hyperparameters:**\n\n*   **DKL:** The neural network will have two hidden layers (32 and 16 neurons) and ReLU activation functions. The base GP will use a RBF kernel.\n*   **QMC:** Use Sobol sequence.\n*   **Thompson Sampling:** No additional hyperparameters are needed.\n\n**Other Possible Techniques:**\n\n*   **Multi-start optimization:** After the Bayesian optimization, local optimization can be performed using the best points found.\n*   **Batch Bayesian Optimization:** Instead of selecting one point at a time, select a batch of points to evaluate in parallel.\n*   **Adaptive Kernels:** Kernels can be adapted during the optimization process to reflect the local structure of the objective function.\n\n**Pseudocode:**\n\n```\nAlgorithm: ThompsonSamplingDKL_BO\n\n1.  Initialize:\n    - Define objective function `objective_fn`, bounds, and budget.\n    - Set `n_initial_points` to 20% of the budget.\n    - Set `n_iterations` to budget - `n_initial_points`.\n    - Generate `n_initial_points` using Sobol sequence QMC sampling within the bounds.\n    - Evaluate the initial points using `objective_fn`.\n    - Initialize `all_x` with the initial points and `all_y` with the corresponding objective function values.\n    - Initialize an empty list `model_losses`.\n\n2.  Fit Initial Model:\n    - Fit the DKL surrogate model to the initial data (X, y).\n    - Evaluate the model using Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL) metric and append it to `model_losses`.\n\n3.  For i = 1 to `n_iterations`:\n    -  Draw a sample from the posterior distribution of the DKL model at a set of candidate points (e.g., generated randomly or using QMC)\n    - Evaluate the sample and find the point that minimizes the sampled function value.\n    - Evaluate the objective function at selected point.\n    - Append the selected point to `all_x` and the objective value to `all_y`.\n    - Fit the DKL surrogate model using the updated data (all_x, all_y).\n    - Evaluate the model using NLL and append the loss to `model_losses`.\n\n4.  Return:\n    - Return `all_y`, `all_x`, `model_losses`, and `n_initial_points`.\n```\n### /Description\n\n### Code\n```python\nfrom typing import Callable\nfrom scipy.stats import qmc\nimport numpy as np\nimport GPy\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nimport torch.optim as optim\nfrom torch.distributions import Normal\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\n\nclass DeepKernelLearning:\n    def __init__(self, input_dim, hidden_dim1=32, hidden_dim2=16, learning_rate=0.01, epochs=1000):\n        self.input_dim = input_dim\n        self.hidden_dim1 = hidden_dim1\n        self.hidden_dim2 = hidden_dim2\n        self.learning_rate = learning_rate\n        self.epochs = epochs\n        self.scaler_X = StandardScaler()\n        self.scaler_y = StandardScaler()\n        self.model = None\n        self.optimizer = None\n        self.loss_fn = lambda y_pred, y_true: -Normal(y_pred, 1e-5).log_prob(y_true).mean()\n    \n    def _build_model(self):\n        model = nn.Sequential(\n            nn.Linear(self.input_dim, self.hidden_dim1),\n            nn.ReLU(),\n            nn.Linear(self.hidden_dim1, self.hidden_dim2),\n            nn.ReLU(),\n            nn.Linear(self.hidden_dim2, 1)\n        )\n        return model\n    \n    def fit(self, X, y):\n        X = np.array(X)\n        y = np.array(y)\n        if X.ndim == 1:\n            X = X.reshape(-1, 1)\n        if y.ndim == 1:\n            y = y.reshape(-1, 1)\n        X_scaled = self.scaler_X.fit_transform(X)\n        y_scaled = self.scaler_y.fit_transform(y)\n        X_tensor = torch.tensor(X_scaled,dtype=torch.float32)\n        y_tensor = torch.tensor(y_scaled,dtype=torch.float32)\n        self.model = self._build_model()\n        self.optimizer = optim.Adam(self.model.parameters(), lr=self.learning_rate)\n\n        for _ in range(self.epochs):\n            self.optimizer.zero_grad()\n            y_pred = self.model(X_tensor)\n            loss = self.loss_fn(y_pred, y_tensor)\n            loss.backward()\n            self.optimizer.step()\n        \n        self.gp_model = GPy.models.GPRegression(self.model(X_tensor).detach().numpy(), y_scaled, GPy.kern.RBF(input_dim=1,ARD=True))\n        self.gp_model.optimize_restarts(num_restarts=5, verbose=False)\n        \n    def predict(self, X):\n        X = np.array(X)\n        if X.ndim == 1:\n            X = X.reshape(-1, 1)\n        X_scaled = self.scaler_X.transform(X)\n        X_tensor = torch.tensor(X_scaled, dtype=torch.float32)\n        with torch.no_grad():\n            y_pred = self.model(X_tensor).detach().numpy()\n        y_pred_unscaled = self.scaler_y.inverse_transform(y_pred)\n        return y_pred_unscaled\n    \n    def predict_dist(self, X):\n        X = np.array(X)\n        if X.ndim == 1:\n            X = X.reshape(-1, 1)\n        X_scaled = self.scaler_X.transform(X)\n        X_tensor = torch.tensor(X_scaled, dtype=torch.float32)\n        with torch.no_grad():\n          y_pred = self.model(X_tensor).detach().numpy()\n        y_pred_unscaled = self.scaler_y.inverse_transform(y_pred)\n        y_pred_unscaled_gp, var_gp = self.gp_model.predict(self.model(X_tensor).detach().numpy())\n        var_unscaled_gp = var_gp * self.scaler_y.scale_**2\n        return y_pred_unscaled, var_unscaled_gp\n    \n    def log_likelihood(self, X, y):\n        X = np.array(X)\n        y = np.array(y)\n        if X.ndim == 1:\n            X = X.reshape(-1, 1)\n        if y.ndim == 1:\n            y = y.reshape(-1, 1)\n        X_scaled = self.scaler_X.transform(X)\n        y_scaled = self.scaler_y.transform(y)\n        X_tensor = torch.tensor(X_scaled,dtype=torch.float32)\n        y_tensor = torch.tensor(y_scaled,dtype=torch.float32)\n        with torch.no_grad():\n          y_pred = self.model(X_tensor)\n        \n        loss = self.loss_fn(y_pred, y_tensor)\n        return loss.item()\n\n\nclass ThompsonSamplingDKL_BO:\n    def __init__(self):\n        pass\n\n    def _sample_points(self, n_points, bounds):\n        sampler = qmc.Sobol(d=bounds.shape[1], scramble=True)\n        sample = sampler.random(n_points)\n        return qmc.scale(sample, bounds[0], bounds[1])\n    \n    def _fit_model(self, X, y):\n        input_dim = X.shape[1]\n        self.dkl_model = DeepKernelLearning(input_dim=input_dim)\n        self.dkl_model.fit(X, y)\n        \n    def _acquisition_function(self, X):\n        y_pred, var = self.dkl_model.predict_dist(X)\n        sampled_values = np.random.normal(y_pred.flatten(), np.sqrt(var.flatten()))\n        return sampled_values\n    \n    def optimize(self, objective_fn:Callable[[np.ndarray], np.ndarray], bounds:np.ndarray, budget:int) -> tuple[np.ndarray, np.ndarray, tuple[np.ndarray, str], int]:\n        self.n_initial_points = int(0.2 * budget)\n        self.n_iterations = budget -

The rest of the code remains the same. \n\nHowever, it is worth noting that in the given code, `DeepKernelLearning` is instantiated inside `ThompsonSamplingDKL_BO` in the `_fit_model` method. The `input_dim` is determined there based on the input data `X`. So, the `input_dim` argument in `DeepKernelLearning`'s `__init__` method is not actually used when the class is instantiated inside `ThompsonSamplingDKL_BO`. \n\nTherefore, instead of assigning a default value of `None` to `input_dim`, we could also consider removing the `input_dim` argument from `DeepKernelLearning`'s `__init__` method altogether, and instead, determine the `input_dim` dynamically inside the `_build_model` method based on the input data. \n\nBut this would require further modifications to the code, and the above solution is a simpler fix to the immediate error.",

The function has a complex landscape with many valleys and peaks, which can lead to convergence issues for traditional optimization methods. The key characteristics of this problem are its multi-modality, non-separability, and the location of its global minimum.\n\nThe main challenges posed by this problem are:\n- **Local optima**: The presence of many local minima can cause optimization algorithms to converge to suboptimal solutions.\n- **Ruggedness**: The function's landscape is highly irregular, making it difficult for algorithms to navigate and find the global minimum.\n- **Search space dimensionality**: Although the problem is two-dimensional, the complexity of the function's landscape makes it challenging to optimize.\n\n#### Algorithm Design\nTo address the challenges posed by the Eggholder test function, we will design a Bayesian Optimization (BO) algorithm that incorporates advanced techniques to improve its performance. The proposed algorithm will use:\n- **Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) sampling**: A QMC method with desirable discrepancy properties will be used to sample the search space efficiently.\n- **Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) with a Mat\u00e9rn kernel**: A GPR model with a Mat\u00e9rn kernel will be used as the surrogate model to approximate the objective function.\n- **Thompson Sampling acquisition function**: Thompson Sampling will be used as the acquisition function to balance exploration and exploitation.\n- **Budget allocation**: The budget will be allocated between the initial points and the number of iterations, with a focus on exploring the search space efficiently.\n\nThe algorithm will be designed to:\n- **Balance exploration and exploitation**: The algorithm will use Thompson Sampling to balance exploration and exploitation, ensuring that the search space is explored efficiently while converging to the global minimum.\n- **Handle multi-modality**: The use of QMC sampling and a GPR model with a Mat\u00e9rn kernel will help the algorithm to handle the multi-modality of the objective function.\n- **Improve convergence**: The algorithm will use a budget allocation strategy to ensure that the search space is explored efficiently, leading to improved convergence to the global minimum.",

The function has a complex landscape with many valleys and peaks, which can lead to convergence issues for traditional optimization methods. The key characteristics of this problem are its multi-modality, non-separability, and the location of its global minimum.\n\nThe main challenges posed by this problem are:\n- **Local optima**: The presence of many local minima can cause optimization algorithms to converge to suboptimal solutions.\n- **Ruggedness**: The function's landscape is highly irregular, making it difficult for algorithms to navigate and find the global minimum.\n- **Search space dimensionality**: Although the problem is two-dimensional, the complexity of the function's landscape makes it challenging to optimize.\n\n#### Algorithm Design\nTo address the challenges posed by the Eggholder test function, we will design a Bayesian Optimization (BO) algorithm that incorporates advanced techniques to improve its performance. The proposed algorithm will use:\n- **Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) sampling**: A QMC method with desirable discrepancy properties will be used to sample the search space efficiently.\n- **Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) with a Mat\u00e9rn kernel**: A GPR model with a Mat\u00e9rn kernel will be used as the surrogate model to approximate the objective function.\n- **Thompson Sampling acquisition function**: Thompson Sampling will be used as the acquisition function to balance exploration and exploitation.\n- **Budget allocation**: The budget will be allocated between the initial points and the number of iterations, with a focus on exploring the search space efficiently.\n\nThe algorithm will be designed to:\n- **Balance exploration and exploitation**: The algorithm will use Thompson Sampling to balance exploration and exploitation, ensuring that the search space is explored efficiently while converging to the global minimum.\n- **Handle multi-modality**: The use of QMC sampling and a GPR model with a Mat\u00e9rn kernel will help the algorithm to handle the multi-modality of the objective function.\n- **Improve convergence**: The algorithm will use a budget allocation strategy to ensure that the search space is explored efficiently, leading to improved convergence to the global minimum.\n\n### /Description\n\n### Code\n```python\nfrom typing import Callable\nfrom scipy.stats import qmc\nimport numpy as np\nfrom botorch.fit import fit_gpytorch_mll\nfrom botorch.models import SingleTaskGP\nfrom botorch.acquisition import qUpperConfidenceBound\nfrom gpytorch.mlls import ExactMarginalLogLikelihood\n\nclass EggholderBO:\n    def __init__(self):\n        # Initialize optimizer settings\n        self.n_initial_points = 10\n        self.acquisition_function = qUpperConfidenceBound\n        self.surrogate_model = SingleTaskGP\n\n    def _sample_points(self, n_points):\n        # Sample points using QMC\n        sampler = qmc.Halton(d=2, scramble=True)\n        points = sampler.random(n=n_points)\n        points = np.array(points) * (512 - (-512)) + (-512)\n        return points\n\n    def _fit_model(self, X, y):\n        # Fit and tune surrogate model\n        model = self.surrogate_model(train_inputs=X, train_targets=y)\n        mll = ExactMarginalLogLikelihood(model.likelihood, model)\n        fit_gpytorch_mll(mll)\n        return model\n\n    def _acquisition_function(self, X, model):\n        # Implement acquisition function\n        acq_func = self.acquisition_function(model=model, beta=0.1)\n        return acq_func\n\n    def optimize(self, objective_fn: Callable[[np.ndarray], np.ndarray], bounds: np.ndarray, budget: int) -> tuple[np.ndarray, np.ndarray, tuple[np.ndarray, str], int]:\n        # Main minimize optimization loop\n        self.n_initial_points = 10\n        self.n_iterations = budget - self.n_initial_points\n        all_x = self._sample_points(self.n_initial_points)\n        all_y = objective_fn(all_x)\n        model_losses = []\n        for i in range(self.n_iterations + 1):\n            model = self._fit_model(all_x, all_y)\n            model_loss = -model.likelihood.log_marginal_likelihood().item()\n            model_losses.append(model_loss)\n            if i < self.n_iterations:\n                acq_func = self._acquisition_function(all_x, model)\n                next_point = self._sample_points(1)\n                while np.any(np.logical_or(next_point < bounds[0], next_point > bounds[1])):\n                    next_point = self._sample_points(1)\n                next_y = objective_fn(next_point)\n                all_x = np.vstack((all_x, next_point))\n                all_y = np.vstack((all_y, next_y))\n        return all_y, all_x, (np.array(model_losses), 'negative log-likelihood'), self.n_initial_points\n\n```\n\n### /Code",

Also, 'train_targets' should be replaced with 'train_targets' being the second element of 'train_data' tuple.\n\n### /Description\n\n### Code\n```python\nfrom typing import Callable\nfrom scipy.stats import qmc\nimport numpy as np\nfrom botorch.fit import fit_gpytorch_mll\nfrom botorch.models import SingleTaskGP\nfrom botorch.acquisition import qUpperConfidenceBound\nfrom gpytorch.mlls import ExactMarginalLogLikelihood\n\nclass EggholderBO:\n    def __init__(self):\n        # Initialize optimizer settings\n        self.n_initial_points = 10\n        self.acquisition_function = qUpperConfidenceBound\n        self.surrogate_model = SingleTaskGP\n\n    def _sample_points(self, n_points):\n        # Sample points using QMC\n        sampler = qmc.Halton(d=2, scramble=True)\n        points = sampler.random(n=n_points)\n        points = np.array(points) * (512 - (-512)) + (-512)\n        return points\n\n    def _fit_model(self, X, y):\n        # Fit and tune surrogate model\n        model = self.surrogate_model(train_data=(X, y))\n        mll = ExactMarginalLogLikelihood(model.likelihood, model)\n        fit_gpytorch_mll(mll)\n        return model\n\n    def _acquisition_function(self, X, model):\n        # Implement acquisition function\n        acq_func = self.acquisition_function(model=model, beta=0.1)\n        return acq_func\n\n    def optimize(self, objective_fn: Callable[[np.ndarray], np.ndarray], bounds: np.ndarray, budget: int) -> tuple[np.ndarray, np.ndarray, tuple[np.ndarray, str], int]:\n        # Main minimize optimization loop\n        self.n_initial_points = 10\n        self.n_iterations = budget - self.n_initial_points\n        all_x = self._sample_points(self.n_initial_points)\n        all_y = objective_fn(all_x)\n        model_losses = []\n        for i in range(self.n_iterations + 1):\n            model = self._fit_model(all_x, all_y)\n            model_loss = -model.likelihood.log_marginal_likelihood().item()\n            model_losses.append(model_loss)\n            if i < self.n_iterations:\n                acq_func = self._acquisition_function(all_x, model)\n                next_point = self._sample_points(1)\n                while np.any(np.logical_or(next_point < bounds[0], next_point > bounds[1])):\n                    next_point = self._sample_points(1)\n                next_y = objective_fn(next_point)\n                all_x = np.vstack((all_x, next_point))\n                all_y = np.vstack((all_y, next_y))\n        return all_y, all_x, (np.array(model_losses), 'negative log-likelihood'), self.n_initial_points\n```\n\n### /Code",
