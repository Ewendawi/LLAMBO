            "description": "### Problem Analysis\nThe DropWave function is a 2-dimensional, multimodal function with a global minimum that is relatively deep and narrow, surrounded by many local minima. It is defined as:\n```\nf(x, y) = - (1 + cos(12*sqrt(x^2 + y^2))) / (0.5 * (x^2 + y^2) + 2)\n```\nKey Characteristics:\n- **Multimodality:** The function has numerous local minima, making it challenging for optimization algorithms to avoid getting trapped.\n- **Non-Separability:** The function involves both `x` and `y` in a coupled manner, meaning it cannot be optimized by optimizing each variable independently.\n- **Global Minimum:** The global minimum is located at (0, 0) with a function value of -1. It's a relatively sharp, narrow well.\n- **Ruggedness:** The surface is relatively smooth but with many oscillations, making it difficult for gradient-based methods to navigate.\n- **Low Dimensionality:** The 2D search space makes visualization and analysis easier, but the multimodality remains a challenge.\n\nChallenges for Optimization:\n- The presence of many local minima makes it crucial to have an algorithm that can effectively explore the search space and avoid premature convergence.\n- The narrow global minimum requires a fine-grained search around the optimal region to achieve good performance.\n- Standard gradient-based methods are likely to fail due to the many local minima.\n- Random search might take a long time to find the optimal region.\n\n### Algorithm Design\n**Aggressiveness:** 0.80\nGiven the problem's multimodality and the narrow global minimum, we need a strategy that balances exploration and exploitation effectively. Therefore, we will opt for an aggressive approach which focuses on adaptive exploration around promising regions.\n\n**Comparison of Bayesian Optimization Strategies:**\n1. **Standard BO with Expected Improvement (EI):** This is a common baseline approach. It uses a Gaussian Process (GP) as a surrogate model and EI as the acquisition function. This approach is easy to implement but might struggle with the multimodality of the DropWave function, potentially getting stuck in local optima.\n2. **BO with Thompson Sampling:** Thompson sampling is a probabilistic approach that samples from the posterior predictive distribution, making it more suited to exploration. It can be more effective than EI in multimodal problems by exploring regions with high uncertainty.\n3. **BO with Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) and a specialized kernel:** UCB is an acquisition function that balances exploration and exploitation by considering the uncertainty of the surrogate model. Combined with a more advanced kernel, such as a Mat\u00e9rn kernel with a learned length scale, it can adapt better to the function's roughness and multimodality.\n\n**Chosen Strategy: Adaptive Exploration BO with Thompson Sampling and Mat\u00e9rn Kernel**\n\n**Sampling Strategy:**\n- We will use a Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) for initial exploration, which provides a good coverage of the search space.\n- For the subsequent iterations, we will rely on the Thompson Sampling acquisition function to select new points based on the surrogate model.\n\n**Budget Allocation:**\n- n_initial_points: A smaller number of initial points is chosen to encourage faster learning of the surrogate model. The initial points will be selected by LHS, which covers the search space more effectively than random sampling.\n- n_iterations: The remaining budget will be allocated to iterations. This allows for a longer period of adaptive learning.\n\n**Surrogate Model:**\n- Instead of a standard Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) with an RBF kernel, we will use GPR with a Mat\u00e9rn kernel. The Mat\u00e9rn kernel is more flexible than the RBF kernel, allowing for better adaptation to the function's roughness by adjusting the smoothness parameter. The length scale parameter will also be optimized.\n- We will use the negative log-likelihood (NLL) as the metric to evaluate the model. The NLL is a standard metric for GPR models, and it allows for the model to fit the data and capture the uncertainty.\n- We will add a small nugget term to the kernel to improve numerical stability.\n\n**Acquisition Function:**\n- We will use Thompson Sampling (TS) as the acquisition function. TS is a probabilistic approach that samples from the posterior predictive distribution to choose the next point. This approach will help us to balance exploration and exploitation effectively, by exploring regions with high uncertainty.\n- The sampling process from the posterior predictive distribution introduces an element of randomness, which is beneficial for escaping local optima.\n\n**Hyperparameters:**\n- Initial Points: 10\n- Kernel: Mat\u00e9rn with nu=2.5 and optimized length scale\n- Acquisition Function: Thompson Sampling\n- Nugget term for kernel: 1e-6\n\n**Other Possible Techniques:**\n- **Adaptive Kernel Parameters:** The length scale parameter of the Mat\u00e9rn kernel will be optimized during the surrogate model fitting. This allows the model to adapt better to the function's roughness and multimodality.\n- **Ensemble of Surrogate Models:** Using an ensemble of GPR models with different kernels could improve the robustness of the approach. However, this would increase the computational cost.\n\n**Pseudocode:**\n```\nAlgorithm: AdaptiveExplorationBO\nInput: objective_fn, bounds, budget\nOutput: all_y, all_x, (model_losses, loss_name), n_initial_points\n\n1.

            "description": "### Problem Analysis\nThe Eggholder function is a challenging non-convex optimization problem characterized by:\n\n1.  **Multi-modality:** It has numerous local minima, making it difficult for optimization algorithms to find the global minimum. The landscape is rugged and contains many \"egg-like\" valleys, hence the name.\n2.  **Non-separability:** The variables `x1` and `x2` are not independent in their effect on the objective function, meaning that optimizing one variable while holding the other constant will not lead to the global optimum.\n3.  **Global Minimum:** The global minimum is located at approximately (512, 404.2319) with a value of -959.6407.\n4.  **Symmetry:** The function exhibits some symmetry, but it is not perfectly symmetrical, adding complexity to the optimization process.\n5.  **Search Space:** The search space is large, a square of side 1024 centered at the origin, which further increases the difficulty of finding the global minimum.\n6.  **Ruggedness:** The function's landscape is very rugged, with steep slopes and sharp changes, making gradient-based methods struggle.\n\nThese characteristics make the Eggholder function a good test case for Bayesian optimization algorithms, as they need to effectively balance exploration and exploitation to locate the global minimum within a complex and challenging landscape. The multi-modality and ruggedness specifically require a robust exploration strategy and a good surrogate model to navigate the search space effectively.\n\n### Algorithm Design\n**Bayesian Optimization Strategies:**\n\nGiven the problem analysis, I will explore three Bayesian Optimization strategies with varying degrees of aggressiveness, balancing the trade-offs between reward and risk based on the given AGGRESSIVENESS (0.80):\n\n1.  **Low Aggressiveness (Exploration-Focused):** This strategy emphasizes exploration to avoid getting trapped in local minima. It will use a Gaussian Process (GP) with a relatively simple kernel and an acquisition function that promotes exploration. This will ensure that we cover the search space sufficiently.\n    *   **Surrogate Model:** Standard Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) with a Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel.\n    *   **Acquisition Function:** Expected Improvement (EI), which balances exploration and exploitation but is less aggressive than UCB.\n    *   **Sampling:** Latin Hypercube Sampling for initial points and random sampling for iterative points.\n2.  **Medium Aggressiveness (Balanced):** This strategy attempts to balance exploration and exploitation by using an acquisition function that is more sensitive to the uncertainty of the surrogate model.\n    *   **Surrogate Model:** GPR with a Mat\u00e9rn kernel, which allows for more flexibility in modeling the function's smoothness.\n    *   **Acquisition Function:** Upper Confidence Bound (UCB), which is more aggressive than EI, favoring regions with high uncertainty.\n    *   **Sampling:** Sobol sequence for initial points and random sampling for iterative points.\n3.  **High Aggressiveness (Exploitation-Focused):** This strategy focuses on exploiting the regions that the model predicts to be promising. This approach is suitable given the high aggressiveness parameter.\n    *   **Surrogate Model:** GPR with a Mat\u00e9rn kernel and a composite kernel (e.g., Mat\u00e9rn + WhiteNoise) to allow for both smooth and noisy features of the function.\n    *   **Acquisition Function:** Thompson Sampling, which explores and exploits based on samples from the posterior distribution.\n    *   **Sampling:** A combination of Latin Hypercube Sampling for initial points and a quasi-Monte Carlo method like Sobol for iterative points, focusing on exploration in early iterations and exploitation in later ones.\n\nGiven the high aggressiveness (0.80), the third strategy is the most suitable.\n\n**Chosen Bayesian Optimization Algorithm:**\n\n*   **Algorithm Name:** `AdaptiveThompsonSamplingBO`\n\n*   **Sampling Strategy:**\n    *   **Comparison:**\n        *   **Random Sampling:** Simple but can lead to poor coverage of the space.\n        *   **Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS):** Provides better coverage than random sampling.\n        *   **Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) (e.g., Sobol):** Offers superior low-discrepancy sequences, ensuring better space-filling properties.\n    *   **Selection:** A combination approach. For the initial points, I will use LHS to ensure a good initial distribution. For the iterative points, I will use a Sobol sequence to ensure a more uniformly distributed sample. This approach aims to balance the need for a good initial sample while maintaining exploration properties throughout the optimization process.\n    *   **Rationale:** Sobol sequences are known for their low discrepancy, which leads to more effective sampling of the search space compared to random sampling.\n\n*   **Budget Allocation:**\n    *   The budget is the total number of evaluations. I will use a fixed number of initial points, and the rest of the budget will be used for iterations. The split between initial points and iterations must be chosen such that the initial points are enough to properly represent the search space, while still allowing enough iterations to fine-tune the solution. Given the high aggressiveness, more iterations are favored. I will set `n_initial_points` to 20, and `n_iterations` = `budget` - 20.\n\n*   **Surrogate Model:**\n    *   **Comparison:**\n        *   **Standard GPR with RBF Kernel:** Simple but might not capture the complex structure of the Eggholder function well.\n        *   **GPR with Mat\u00e9rn Kernel:** More flexible than RBF, able to adjust to different smoothness.\n    *   **Selection:** GPR with a Mat\u00e9rn kernel and a composite kernel (Mat\u00e9rn + WhiteNoise).\n    *   **Rationale:** The Mat\u00e9rn kernel is more flexible than RBF and can model various degrees of smoothness. The addition of WhiteNoise allows the model to account for potential noise in the data, increasing its robustness.\n    *   **Hyperparameter Tuning:** We will tune the kernel's lengthscale and noise variance by maximizing the negative log-likelihood.\n\n*   **Metric:**\n    *   **Selection:** Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL).\n    *   **Rationale:** NLL is a standard metric for evaluating the fit of a probabilistic model like GP. Minimizing NLL will lead to a model that is better at representing the data.\n\n*   **Acquisition Function:**\n    *   **Comparison:**\n        *   **Probability of Improvement (PI):** Simple but can be too exploitative.\n        *   **Expected Improvement (EI):** Balances exploration and exploitation, but can get stuck in local optima.\n        *   **Upper Confidence Bound (UCB):** More aggressive than EI, favoring regions with high uncertainty.\n        *   **Thompson Sampling (TS):** Samples from the posterior distribution, naturally balances exploration and exploitation.\n    *   **Selection:** Thompson Sampling.\n    *   **Rationale:** Thompson Sampling is more robust to multi-modality and can handle the ruggedness of the Eggholder function better than other methods due to its probabilistic nature. It naturally explores uncertain regions while exploiting regions with high predicted values. It also has a more natural exploration-exploitation tradeoff.\n    *   **Hyperparameters:** The parameter of Thompson Sampling does not need to be tuned.\n\n*   **Other Possible Techniques:**\n    *   **Multi-Fidelity Optimization:** If lower fidelity evaluations were available, this could significantly speed up the optimization process.\n    *   **Parallelization:** Evaluating multiple points simultaneously can reduce the total runtime.\n    *   **Gradient-Based Methods:** If the function's gradient information was available, a hybrid approach combining Bayesian Optimization and gradient methods might be promising.\n\n*   **Pseudocode:**\n    ```\n    Algorithm: AdaptiveThompsonSamplingBO\n\n    Input: objective_fn, bounds, budget\n    Output: all_y, all_x, model_losses, n_initial_points\n\n    Initialize:\n        n_initial_points = 20\n        n_iterations = budget - n_initial_points\n        X_initial = Latin Hypercube Sample(n_initial_points, bounds)\n        y_initial = objective_fn(X_initial)\n        X_all = X_initial\n        y_all = y_initial\n        model_losses = []\n        \n    Fit Surrogate Model:\n        GP = Gaussian Process with Mat\u00e9rn + WhiteNoise Kernel\n        Tune GP hyperparameters by minimizing NLL on (X_initial, y_initial)\n        model_loss = NLL(GP, X_initial, y_initial)\n        model_losses.append(model_loss)\n\n    for i from 1 to n_iterations:\n        X_next = Thompson Sampling(GP, bounds)\n        y_next = objective_fn(X_next)\n        X_all.append(X_next)\n        y_all.append(y_next)\n\n        Fit Surrogate Model:\n            Tune GP hyperparameters by minimizing NLL on (X_all, y_all)\n            model_loss = NLL(GP, X_all, y_all)\n            model_losses.append(model_loss)\n    \n    Return: y_all, X_all, (model_losses, \"Negative Log-Likelihood\"), n_initial_points\n    ```",

I will set `n_initial_points` to 20, and `n_iterations` = `budget` - 20.\n\n*   **Surrogate Model:**\n    *   **Comparison:**\n        *   **Standard GPR with RBF Kernel:** Simple but might not capture the complex structure of the Eggholder function well.\n        *   **GPR with Mat\u00e9rn Kernel:** More flexible than RBF, able to adjust to different smoothness.\n    *   **Selection:** GPR with a Mat\u00e9rn kernel and a composite kernel (Mat\u00e9rn + WhiteNoise).\n    *   **Rationale:** The Mat\u00e9rn kernel is more flexible than RBF and can model various degrees of smoothness. The addition of WhiteNoise allows the model to account for potential noise in the data, increasing its robustness.\n    *   **Hyperparameter Tuning:** We will tune the kernel's lengthscale and noise variance by maximizing the negative log-likelihood.\n\n*   **Metric:**\n    *   **Selection:** Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL).\n    *   **Rationale:** NLL is a standard metric for evaluating the fit of a probabilistic model like GP. Minimizing NLL will lead to a model that is better at representing the data.\n\n*   **Acquisition Function:**\n    *   **Comparison:**\n        *   **Probability of Improvement (PI):** Simple but can be too exploitative.\n        *   **Expected Improvement (EI):** Balances exploration and exploitation, but can get stuck in local optima.\n        *   **Upper Confidence Bound (UCB):** More aggressive than EI, favoring regions with high uncertainty.\n        *   **Thompson Sampling (TS):** Samples from the posterior distribution, naturally balances exploration and exploitation.\n    *   **Selection:** Thompson Sampling.\n    *   **Rationale:** Thompson Sampling is more robust to multi-modality and can handle the ruggedness of the Eggholder function better than other methods due to its probabilistic nature. It naturally explores uncertain regions while exploiting regions with high predicted values. It also has a more natural exploration-exploitation tradeoff.\n    *   **Hyperparameters:** The parameter of Thompson Sampling does not need to be tuned.\n\n*   **Other Possible Techniques:**\n    *   **Multi-Fidelity Optimization:** If lower fidelity evaluations were available, this could significantly speed up the optimization process.\n    *   **Parallelization:** Evaluating multiple points simultaneously can reduce the total runtime.\n    *   **Gradient-Based Methods:** If the function's gradient information was available, a hybrid approach combining Bayesian Optimization and gradient methods might be promising.\n\n*   **Pseudocode:**\n    ```\n    Algorithm: AdaptiveThompsonSamplingBO\n\n    Input: objective_fn, bounds, budget\n    Output: all_y, all_x, model_losses, n_initial_points\n\n    Initialize:\n        n_initial_points = 20\n        n_iterations = budget -

            "description": "#### Problem Analysis\nThe Powell function is a multi-modal, non-convex optimization problem that is challenging for many optimization algorithms. It exhibits a valley-like structure, making it difficult for gradient-based methods to navigate towards the global minimum. It is also known to be ill-conditioned and has a relatively flat region around the global minimum. The separability of the function is partial, as the variables are coupled in groups of four, which means that the optimization of one group of variables affects the optimization of the others. The global minimum is at `(0, ..., 0)` with a function value of 0. The search space is bounded, which allows us to define a reasonable sampling space for Bayesian optimization. The dimensionality is 6, which is considered moderate, and should not pose a significant challenge for Bayesian Optimization. However, the multi-modality and the flat region require an algorithm that balances exploration and exploitation effectively.\n\n#### Algorithm Design\nGiven the characteristics of the Powell function, a Bayesian Optimization algorithm with the following components is proposed:\n\n**Aggressiveness:** 0.80\n\n**Sampling Strategy**: We will use a Sobol sequence to generate initial points and also to sample points during the optimization loop. The Sobol sequence is a low-discrepancy quasi-Monte Carlo method. It provides better space-filling properties compared to random sampling, which is crucial for efficient exploration, especially in moderate-dimensional spaces. For the initial points, we will use a number proportional to the dimension (6) and the budget. For the following iterations, we will sample one point at a time.\n\n**Budget Allocation**: The budget will be split into initial points and iterations, with the number of initial points determined by the dimension of the problem and a small fraction of the total budget. This approach allows for a good initial exploration of the search space and ensures we have enough iterations to refine the search.\n\n**Surrogate Model**: Instead of using a standard Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) with a common kernel, we will employ a GPR with a Mat\u00e9rn kernel. The Mat\u00e9rn kernel is a generalization of the RBF kernel and offers more flexibility in controlling the smoothness of the surrogate model. The parameter `nu` in the Mat\u00e9rn kernel can be adjusted to control the smoothness. We will tune this parameter using a grid search based on the negative log-likelihood. The model will be refitted at each iteration using the updated data.\n\n**Metric**: The negative log-likelihood (NLL) will be used to evaluate the model. NLL is a suitable metric to assess the goodness of fit for the GPR model and to tune hyperparameters.\n\n**Acquisition Function**: We will use Thompson Sampling as the acquisition function. Thompson Sampling is a probabilistic acquisition function that samples from the posterior distribution of the surrogate model. It is known to balance exploration and exploitation effectively and is particularly beneficial in multi-modal optimization problems. It can be more robust to local optima than deterministic acquisition functions like Expected Improvement.\n\n**Other Possible Techniques**:\n- **Multi-start Optimization**: This approach can help to escape local optima. We can perform a few iterations of local optimization starting from different points selected by the acquisition function. However, we will not implement it in this version of algorithm because it is computationally expensive.\n- **Batch Bayesian Optimization**: This approach can be used to evaluate multiple points simultaneously. This can be beneficial in parallel computing environments.\n- **Local Search**: After the Bayesian optimization, we can perform a local search starting from the best point found by the Bayesian optimization.\n\n**Pseudocode:**\n\n1.  **Initialization:**\n    *   Define the search space bounds.\n    *   Set the number of initial points `n_initial_points` based on the dimension and the budget.\n    *   Generate initial points `X` using a Sobol sequence.\n    *   Evaluate the objective function at the initial points, `y = objective_fn(X)`.\n    *   Initialize a list to store the model losses called `model_losses`.\n    *   Initialize the best found value `best_y` and the best found point `best_x` based on the initial points.\n    *   Fit GPR model with Mat\u00e9rn kernel to `(X, y)`.\n    *   Calculate the negative log-likelihood and add the value to `model_losses`.\n2.  **Optimization Loop:**\n    *   For `i = 1` to `n_iterations`:\n        *   Generate a sample from the posterior distribution of the surrogate model.\n        *   Find the point `x_next` that maximizes the sample from the posterior distribution using L-BFGS-B.\n        *   Evaluate the objective function at `x_next`, `y_next = objective_fn(x_next)`.\n        *   Append `x_next` to `X` and `y_next` to `y`.\n        *   Update the best found value and point if `y_next` is better than `best_y`.\n        *   Refit GPR model with Mat\u00e9rn kernel to `(X, y)`.\n        *   Calculate the negative log-likelihood and add the value to `model_losses`.\n3.  **Return:**\n    *   Return all evaluated `y`, all evaluated `X`, `(model_losses, \"negative log-likelihood\")`, and `n_initial_points`.",

It exhibits a valley-like structure, making it difficult for gradient-based methods to navigate towards the global minimum. It is also known to be ill-conditioned and has a relatively flat region around the global minimum. The separability of the function is partial, as the variables are coupled in groups of four, which means that the optimization of one group of variables affects the optimization of the others. The global minimum is at `(0, ..., 0)` with a function value of 0. The search space is bounded, which allows us to define a reasonable sampling space for Bayesian optimization. The dimensionality is 6, which is considered moderate, and should not pose a significant challenge for Bayesian Optimization. However, the multi-modality and the flat region require an algorithm that balances exploration and exploitation effectively.\n\n#### Algorithm Design\nGiven the characteristics of the Powell function, a Bayesian Optimization algorithm with the following components is proposed:\n\n**Aggressiveness:** 0.80\n\n**Sampling Strategy**: We will use a Sobol sequence to generate initial points and also to sample points during the optimization loop. The Sobol sequence is a low-discrepancy quasi-Monte Carlo method. It provides better space-filling properties compared to random sampling, which is crucial for efficient exploration, especially in moderate-dimensional spaces. For the initial points, we will use a number proportional to the dimension (6) and the budget. For the following iterations, we will sample one point at a time.\n\n**Budget Allocation**: The budget will be split into initial points and iterations, with the number of initial points determined by the dimension of the problem and a small fraction of the total budget. This approach allows for a good initial exploration of the search space and ensures we have enough iterations to refine the search.\n\n**Surrogate Model**: Instead of using a standard Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) with a common kernel, we will employ a GPR with a Mat\u00e9rn kernel. The Mat\u00e9rn kernel is a generalization of the RBF kernel and offers more flexibility in controlling the smoothness of the surrogate model. The parameter `nu` in the Mat\u00e9rn kernel can be adjusted to control the smoothness. We will tune this parameter using a grid search based on the negative log-likelihood. The model will be refitted at each iteration using the updated data.\n\n**Metric**: The negative log-likelihood (NLL) will be used to evaluate the model. NLL is a suitable metric to assess the goodness of fit for the GPR model and to tune hyperparameters.\n\n**Acquisition Function**: We will use Thompson Sampling as the acquisition function. Thompson Sampling is a probabilistic acquisition function that samples from the posterior distribution of the surrogate model. It is known to balance exploration and exploitation effectively and is particularly beneficial in multi-modal optimization problems. It can be more robust to local optima than deterministic acquisition functions like Expected Improvement.\n\n**Other Possible Techniques**:\n- **Multi-start Optimization**: This approach can help to escape local optima. We can perform a few iterations of local optimization starting from different points selected by the acquisition function. However, we will not implement it in this version of algorithm because it is computationally expensive.\n- **Batch Bayesian Optimization**: This approach can be used to evaluate multiple points simultaneously. This can be beneficial in parallel computing environments.\n- **Local Search**: After the Bayesian optimization, we can perform a local search starting from the best point found by the Bayesian optimization.\n\n**Pseudocode:**\n\n1.  **Initialization:**\n    *   Define the search space bounds.\n    *   Set the number of initial points `n_initial_points` based on the dimension and the budget.\n    *   Generate initial points `X` using a Sobol sequence.\n    *   Evaluate the objective function at the initial points, `y = objective_fn(X)`.\n    *   Initialize a list to store the model losses called `model_losses`.\n    *   Initialize the best found value `best_y` and the best found point `best_x` based on the initial points.\n    *   Fit GPR model with Mat\u00e9rn kernel to `(X, y)`.\n    *   Calculate the negative log-likelihood and add the value to `model_losses`.\n2.  **Optimization Loop:**\n    *   For `i = 1` to `n_iterations`:\n        *   Generate a sample from the posterior distribution of the surrogate model.\n        *   Find the point `x_next` that maximizes the sample from the posterior distribution using L-BFGS-B.\n        *   Evaluate the objective function at `x_next`, `y_next = objective_fn(x_next)`.\n        *   Append `x_next` to `X` and `y_next` to `y`.\n        *   Update the best found value and point if `y_next` is better than `best_y`.\n        *   Refit GPR model with Mat\u00e9rn kernel to `(X, y)`.\n        *   Calculate the negative log-likelihood and add the value to `model_losses`.\n3.  **Return:**\n    *   Return all evaluated `y`, all evaluated `X`, `(model_losses, \"negative log-likelihood\")`, and `n_initial_points`.\n### /Description\n\n### Code\n```python\nfrom typing import Callable\nfrom scipy.stats import qmc\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.gaussian_process import GaussianProcessRegressor\nfrom sklearn.gaussian_process.kernels import Matern\nfrom scipy.optimize import minimize\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\nfrom scipy.stats import norm\n\nclass ThompsonSamplingBO:\n    def __init__(self, nu_values = [0.5, 1.5, 2.5]):\n        # Initialize optimizer settings\n        self.nu_values = nu_values\n        self.scaler_X = StandardScaler()\n        self.scaler_y = StandardScaler()\n\n\n    def _sample_points(self, n_points, bounds):\n        # sample points\n        sampler = qmc.Sobol(d=bounds.shape[1], scramble=True)\n        sample = sampler.random(n_points)\n        return qmc.scale(sample, bounds[0], bounds[1])\n    \n    def _fit_model(self, X, y):\n        # Fit and tune surrogate model \n        X_scaled = self.scaler_X.fit_transform(X)\n        y_scaled = self.scaler_y.fit_transform(y.reshape(-1, 1)).flatten()\n        best_nll = float('inf')\n        best_kernel = None\n        for nu in self.nu_values:\n            kernel = Matern(nu=nu)\n            gpr = GaussianProcessRegressor(kernel=kernel, n_restarts_optimizer=5)\n            gpr.fit(X_scaled, y_scaled)\n            nll = -gpr.log_marginal_likelihood(gpr.kernel_.theta)\n            if nll < best_nll:\n                best_nll = nll\n                best_kernel = kernel\n        self.gpr = GaussianProcessRegressor(kernel=best_kernel, n_restarts_optimizer=5)\n        self.gpr.fit(X_scaled, y_scaled)\n        return -self.gpr.log_marginal_likelihood(self.gpr.kernel_.theta)\n    \n    def _acquisition_function(self, X):\n        # Implement acquisition function \n        # Handle exploration-exploitation trade-off\n        X_scaled = self.scaler_X.transform(X)\n        mu, sigma = self.gpr.predict(X_scaled, return_std=True)\n        sample = norm.rvs(mu, sigma)\n        return sample\n    \n    def optimize(self, objective_fn:Callable[[np.ndarray], np.ndarray], bounds:np.ndarray, budget:int) -> tuple[np.ndarray, np.ndarray, tuple[np.ndarray, str], int]:\n        # Main minimize optimization loop\n        # objective_fn: Callable[[np.ndarray], np.ndarray], takes array of shape (n_points, n_dims) and returns array of shape (n_points, 1)\n        # bounds has shape (2,<dimemsion>), bounds[0]: lower bound, bounds[1]: upper bound\n        # Do not change the function signature\n        # Evaluate the model using the metric you choose and record the value as model_loss after each training. the size of the model_loss should be equal to the number of iterations plus one for the fit on initial points.\n        # Return a tuple (all_y, all_x, (model_losses, loss_name), n_initial_points)\n        self.n_initial_points = max(5,int(0.1 * budget))\n        self.n_iterations = budget -

            "description": "### Problem Analysis\nThe Rosenbrock function is a non-convex function, known for its banana-shaped valley that makes it challenging for optimization algorithms to converge to the global minimum. Its characteristics include:\n\n- **Multi-modality:** Although it technically has only one global minimum, the flat and curved valley creates a large area of low gradient, which can be deceptive for optimization algorithms and lead them to get stuck in the valley rather than move towards the minimum.\n- **Non-separability:** The variables are not independent, meaning that changing one variable affects the others. This non-separability makes it difficult to optimize each variable independently.\n- **Global Minimum:** The global minimum is at `(1, 1, ..., 1)`, with a function value of 0.0.\n- **Ruggedness:** The function is not particularly rugged, but the flat valley can be challenging for gradient-based methods. The challenge comes from the flat region around the optimal solution.\n- **Dimensionality:** In this case, the dimensionality is 6, which is not extremely high but still makes the search space large enough to necessitate efficient exploration strategies.\n- **Search Space:** The search space is defined by the bounds `[-5, 10]` for each dimension. This provides a relatively large search space that includes the global minimum.\n\nThe main challenges for optimization algorithms are to:\n1. Efficiently escape the flat valley of the function.\n2. Explore the space sufficiently to avoid being trapped in local optima.\n3. Handle the non-separability of the variables.\n\n### Algorithm Design\nGiven the characteristics of the Rosenbrock function, we will design a Bayesian Optimization algorithm that focuses on efficient exploration and exploitation. The strategy is to use a combination of advanced techniques to tackle the challenges of the problem.\n\n**Overall Aggressiveness:** 0.80 (High aggressiveness)\nWe will choose a relatively high aggressiveness to balance the exploration and exploitation trade-off, given the known challenges of the Rosenbrock function.\n\n**Bayesian Optimization Strategies Comparison:**\n1. **Standard BO (Low Aggressiveness):**\n    - Sampling: Random sampling or Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS).\n    - Surrogate: Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) with RBF kernel.\n    - Acquisition: Expected Improvement (EI).\n    -  This approach is basic and may struggle with the flat regions of the Rosenbrock function.\n2.  **BO with QMC and Advanced Acquisition (Medium Aggressiveness):**\n    - Sampling:  Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) sampling (e.g., Sobol sequence) to cover the space more uniformly.\n    - Surrogate: GPR with Matern kernel to be more robust to noisy observations.\n    - Acquisition: Thompson Sampling, which promotes a balance between exploration and exploitation.\n    - This approach aims to improve the sampling and acquisition strategies to handle the multi-modality and non-convexity better.\n3. **BO with QMC, Neural Network Surrogate, and Information Gain (High Aggressiveness):**\n    - Sampling: QMC (Sobol) to cover the space more uniformly.\n    - Surrogate: Deep Neural Network (DNN) that can learn more complex relationships in the data and potentially generalize better than GPR.\n    - Acquisition: Information Gain (IG) to select points that maximize the reduction in uncertainty about the objective function.\n    - This strategy is the most aggressive, aiming to use a more powerful surrogate model and an exploration-focused acquisition function, which is more likely to be effective when the function landscape is complex.\n\n**Chosen Strategy: BO with QMC, Neural Network Surrogate, and Information Gain (High Aggressiveness)**\nThis strategy is chosen because of its potential to overcome the challenges posed by the Rosenbrock function. The combination of QMC sampling, a DNN surrogate model, and an Information Gain acquisition function is designed to promote more efficient exploration and exploitation.\n\n**Specific Algorithm Design:**\n\n1. **Sampling Strategy:**\n    - **Comparison:** Random sampling can lead to uneven coverage of the search space, while LHS provides a more uniform spread. However, QMC methods, like the Sobol sequence, offer even better uniformity and low discrepancy properties, making them particularly suitable for higher-dimensional problems.\n    - **Selection:** We will use the Sobol sequence for initial sampling and for generating new points during optimization. This method provides better space-filling properties than random or LHS, which will be helpful in exploring the Rosenbrock function's search space.\n\n2. **Budget Strategy:**\n    - We will allocate a larger portion of the budget to exploration, which is important for the Rosenbrock problem.\n    - **Strategy:** We will use 20% of the budget for initial points and the remaining 80% for iterations. Therefore, if the budget is `B`, then `n_initial_points = 0.2*B`, and `n_iterations = 0.8*B`. We will round down the number of initial points and round up the number of iterations to make sure they sum up to the budget.\n\n3. **Surrogate Model:**\n    - **Comparison:** Standard GPR with RBF or Matern kernels is widely used, but it might struggle to capture complex relationships in the objective function.\n    - **Selection:** We will use a Deep Neural Network (DNN) as a surrogate model. DNNs can learn more complex functions than GPR, which could be useful in modeling the Rosenbrock function. We will use a simple feedforward network with two hidden layers and ReLU activation. This can potentially improve the accuracy of the surrogate model and lead to better optimization performance.\n    - **Metric:** We'll use the negative log-likelihood (NLL) to evaluate the performance of the DNN surrogate model. It measures how well the model's predicted distribution matches the observed data.\n\n4. **Acquisition Function:**\n    - **Comparison:** Expected Improvement (EI) and Probability of Improvement (PI) are common choices, but they can be too exploitative. Thompson Sampling is good for balancing exploration and exploitation.\n    - **Selection:** We will use an Information Gain (IG) based acquisition function. This function selects points that maximize the reduction in the uncertainty about the objective function.

                "raw_response": "### Description\n### Problem Analysis\nThe Rosenbrock function is a non-convex function, known for its banana-shaped valley that makes it challenging for optimization algorithms to converge to the global minimum. Its characteristics include:\n\n- **Multi-modality:** Although it technically has only one global minimum, the flat and curved valley creates a large area of low gradient, which can be deceptive for optimization algorithms and lead them to get stuck in the valley rather than move towards the minimum.\n- **Non-separability:** The variables are not independent, meaning that changing one variable affects the others. This non-separability makes it difficult to optimize each variable independently.\n- **Global Minimum:** The global minimum is at `(1, 1, ..., 1)`, with a function value of 0.0.\n- **Ruggedness:** The function is not particularly rugged, but the flat valley can be challenging for gradient-based methods. The challenge comes from the flat region around the optimal solution.\n- **Dimensionality:** In this case, the dimensionality is 6, which is not extremely high but still makes the search space large enough to necessitate efficient exploration strategies.\n- **Search Space:** The search space is defined by the bounds `[-5, 10]` for each dimension. This provides a relatively large search space that includes the global minimum.\n\nThe main challenges for optimization algorithms are to:\n1. Efficiently escape the flat valley of the function.\n2. Explore the space sufficiently to avoid being trapped in local optima.\n3. Handle the non-separability of the variables.\n\n### Algorithm Design\nGiven the characteristics of the Rosenbrock function, we will design a Bayesian Optimization algorithm that focuses on efficient exploration and exploitation. The strategy is to use a combination of advanced techniques to tackle the challenges of the problem.\n\n**Overall Aggressiveness:** 0.80 (High aggressiveness)\nWe will choose a relatively high aggressiveness to balance the exploration and exploitation trade-off, given the known challenges of the Rosenbrock function.\n\n**Bayesian Optimization Strategies Comparison:**\n1. **Standard BO (Low Aggressiveness):**\n    - Sampling: Random sampling or Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS).\n    - Surrogate: Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) with RBF kernel.\n    - Acquisition: Expected Improvement (EI).\n    -  This approach is basic and may struggle with the flat regions of the Rosenbrock function.\n2.  **BO with QMC and Advanced Acquisition (Medium Aggressiveness):**\n    - Sampling:  Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) sampling (e.g., Sobol sequence) to cover the space more uniformly.\n    - Surrogate: GPR with Matern kernel to be more robust to noisy observations.\n    - Acquisition: Thompson Sampling, which promotes a balance between exploration and exploitation.\n    - This approach aims to improve the sampling and acquisition strategies to handle the multi-modality and non-convexity better.\n3. **BO with QMC, Neural Network Surrogate, and Information Gain (High Aggressiveness):**\n    - Sampling: QMC (Sobol) to cover the space more uniformly.\n    - Surrogate: Deep Neural Network (DNN) that can learn more complex relationships in the data and potentially generalize better than GPR.\n    - Acquisition: Information Gain (IG) to select points that maximize the reduction in uncertainty about the objective function.\n    - This strategy is the most aggressive, aiming to use a more powerful surrogate model and an exploration-focused acquisition function, which is more likely to be effective when the function landscape is complex.\n\n**Chosen Strategy: BO with QMC, Neural Network Surrogate, and Information Gain (High Aggressiveness)**\nThis strategy is chosen because of its potential to overcome the challenges posed by the Rosenbrock function. The combination of QMC sampling, a DNN surrogate model, and an Information Gain acquisition function is designed to promote more efficient exploration and exploitation.\n\n**Specific Algorithm Design:**\n\n1. **Sampling Strategy:**\n    - **Comparison:** Random sampling can lead to uneven coverage of the search space, while LHS provides a more uniform spread. However, QMC methods, like the Sobol sequence, offer even better uniformity and low discrepancy properties, making them particularly suitable for higher-dimensional problems.\n    - **Selection:** We will use the Sobol sequence for initial sampling and for generating new points during optimization. This method provides better space-filling properties than random or LHS, which will be helpful in exploring the Rosenbrock function's search space.\n\n2. **Budget Strategy:**\n    - We will allocate a larger portion of the budget to exploration, which is important for the Rosenbrock problem.\n    - **Strategy:** We will use 20% of the budget for initial points and the remaining 80% for iterations. Therefore, if the budget is `B`, then `n_initial_points = 0.2*B`, and `n_iterations = 0.8*B`. We will round down the number of initial points and round up the number of iterations to make sure they sum up to the budget.\n\n3. **Surrogate Model:**\n    - **Comparison:** Standard GPR with RBF or Matern kernels is widely used, but it might struggle to capture complex relationships in the objective function.\n    - **Selection:** We will use a Deep Neural Network (DNN) as a surrogate model. DNNs can learn more complex functions than GPR, which could be useful in modeling the Rosenbrock function. We will use a simple feedforward network with two hidden layers and ReLU activation. This can potentially improve the accuracy of the surrogate model and lead to better optimization performance.\n    - **Metric:** We'll use the negative log-likelihood (NLL) to evaluate the performance of the DNN surrogate model. It measures how well the model's predicted distribution matches the observed data.\n\n4. **Acquisition Function:**\n    - **Comparison:** Expected Improvement (EI) and Probability of Improvement (PI) are common choices, but they can be too exploitative. Thompson Sampling is good for balancing exploration and exploitation.\n    - **Selection:** We will use an Information Gain (IG) based acquisition function. This function selects points that maximize the reduction in the uncertainty about the objective function. In the context of a DNN surrogate model, IG can be approximated by computing the change in the predictive entropy. This is expected to be more effective at exploring the search space and escaping the flat region of the Rosenbrock function.\n    - **Hyperparameters:** For the Information Gain acquisition function, we will use the predictive entropy as the uncertainty measure.\n\n5. **Other Techniques:**\n    -   **Batch Optimization:** We can evaluate multiple points in parallel to speed up the optimization process, but this would increase the complexity. We will not implement this for now, but it is a good option for future implementation.\n    -   **Adaptive Hyperparameter Tuning:** Dynamically adjusting the learning rate of the DNN, or the number of layers can significantly improve the performance.\n    -   **Ensemble Surrogates:** Using multiple surrogate models and combining their predictions can improve the robustness of the optimization process.\n\n**Pseudocode:**\n\n```\nAlgorithm: DNN_IG_BO\n\nInput: objective_fn, bounds, budget\nOutput: all_y, all_x, (model_losses, loss_name), n_initial_points\n\n1.

                "raw_response": "### Description\n### Problem Analysis\nThe Michalewicz function is a multimodal, non-separable, and non-convex function, which makes it challenging for optimization algorithms. The function has many local minima, and the global minimum is difficult to locate, especially in higher dimensions. In 6D, the search space is [0, pi]^6, and the function exhibits a complex landscape with a rugged shape. The key challenges for optimization algorithms include:\n    - **Multimodality**: The presence of numerous local minima can easily trap algorithms, preventing them from reaching the global minimum.\n    - **Non-separability**: The function cannot be optimized by considering each dimension independently, requiring algorithms to handle interdependencies between variables.\n    - **Ruggedness**: The function's landscape is characterized by sharp changes and steep gradients, making it difficult for gradient-based methods to converge.\n    - **Exploration-Exploitation Trade-off**: A good balance between exploring the search space to find the basin of attraction of the global minimum and exploiting the current best solution is crucial.\n### /Problem Analysis\n\n### Algorithm Design\n**Bayesian Optimization Strategies**\n1.  **Standard Gaussian Process BO (Low Aggressiveness):**\n    -   **Surrogate Model**: Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) with a Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel.\n    -   **Acquisition Function**: Expected Improvement (EI).\n    -   **Rationale**: This is a standard and well-understood approach. It's less aggressive and relies on a smooth surrogate model and a widely used acquisition function. It may struggle with the multimodality of the Michalewicz function, potentially getting trapped in local minima, but it serves as a good baseline.\n2.  **Gaussian Process BO with Thompson Sampling (Medium Aggressiveness):**\n    -   **Surrogate Model**: Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) with a Mat\u00e9rn kernel.\n    -   **Acquisition Function**: Thompson Sampling.\n    -   **Rationale**: Thompson Sampling is a probabilistic approach that samples from the posterior distribution of the surrogate model. This can provide better exploration of the search space, especially in multimodal functions, by balancing exploration and exploitation.\n3.  **Gaussian Process BO with Quasi-Monte Carlo Sampling and Improved Acquisition Function (High Aggressiveness):**\n    -   **Surrogate Model**: Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) with a Mat\u00e9rn kernel.\n    -   **Sampling Strategy**: Use quasi-Monte Carlo sampling (e.g., Sobol sequence) for initial points and for candidate generation in each iteration.\n    -   **Acquisition Function**: A modified Expected Improvement that encourages both exploration and exploitation by adding a diversity term, which penalizes sampling near the already evaluated points.\n    -   **Rationale**: This strategy aims to provide more effective exploration by using quasi-Monte Carlo sampling for better coverage of the search space and improved exploration in the acquisition function. This approach also aims at a better balance between exploration and exploitation, which is crucial for multimodal functions.\n\n**Selected Algorithm: Gaussian Process BO with Quasi-Monte Carlo Sampling and Improved Acquisition Function (High Aggressiveness)**\n\n-   **Aggressiveness**: 0.80\n-   **Sampling Strategy**:\n    -   **Comparison**:\n        -   **Random Sampling**: Simple but can lead to clustering and uneven coverage.\n        -   **Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS)**: Better space coverage than random sampling, but can still have some clustering.\n        -   **Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC)**: Provides low-discrepancy sequences, leading to more even and efficient coverage of the search space.\n    -   **Choice**: Sobol sequence, a QMC method known for its good properties in high-dimensional spaces. It provides a more uniform distribution of samples, which improves exploration efficiency. This is implemented using scipy.stats.qmc.\n    -   **Justification**: The multimodal nature of the Michalewicz function and the need for effective exploration make QMC sampling a suitable choice.\n-   **Budget Strategy**:\n    -   We will use 2 * dimension for initial points, and the rest of the budget for iterations.\n-   **Surrogate Model**:\n    -   **Comparison**:\n        -   **Gaussian Process with RBF Kernel**: Smooth, suitable for simple problems, but may not capture the complexity of the Michalewicz function.\n        -   **Gaussian Process with Mat\u00e9rn Kernel**: More flexible, can capture a wider range of functions, better for rugged landscapes.\n    -   **Choice**: Gaussian Process with a Mat\u00e9rn kernel (nu=2.5).\n    -   **Justification**: The Mat\u00e9rn kernel is more flexible and can model a wider range of functions with varying degrees of smoothness. The rugged landscape of the Michalewicz function makes the Mat\u00e9rn kernel a better choice than the RBF kernel.\n    -   **Metric:** Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL)\n    -   **Justification:** NLL is a standard metric to evaluate the goodness of fit of probabilistic models, such as Gaussian Processes.\n-   **Acquisition Function**:\n    -   **Comparison**:\n        -   **Expected Improvement (EI)**: Balances exploration and exploitation, but can get stuck in local optima.\n        -   **Probability of Improvement (PI)**: Focuses more on exploitation, may not explore sufficiently.\n        -   **Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)**: Tends to be more exploratory but may be overly optimistic.\n        -   **Thompson Sampling**: Effective at balancing exploration and exploitation, but can be noisy.\n    -   **Choice**: A modified Expected Improvement (EI) with a diversity term that penalizes sampling near already evaluated points. The diversity term is computed by summing the inverse distance from all current sampled points. The formula is:\n        ```\n        EI_modified(x) = EI(x) - beta * diversity(x)\n        ```\n        Where beta is a hyperparameter that controls the strength of the diversity penalty.\n    -   **Justification**: The modified EI aims to improve exploration by discouraging the algorithm from sampling too close to the existing points and thus increase the chance of finding new areas with better objective values. This addresses the multimodality issue by forcing the algorithm to explore beyond the local minima.\n-   **Hyperparameters**:\n    -   **Mat\u00e9rn Kernel**: nu=2.5\n    -   **Modified EI**: beta = 0.1\n-   **Other Possible Techniques**:\n    -   **Multi-Fidelity Optimization**: Using lower-fidelity approximations of the Michalewicz function to guide the search, which can significantly reduce the cost of function evaluations.\n    -   **Parallel Bayesian Optimization**: Evaluating multiple points in parallel, which can speed up the optimization process.\n    -   **Trust Region Methods**: Adapting the trust region based on the uncertainty of the GP model, ensuring that exploitation is focused in regions where the model is confident and exploration is done in uncertain regions.\n-   **Pseudocode**:\n    ```\n    Algorithm: Modified_EI_QMC_BO\n\n    Input: objective_fn, bounds, budget\n    Output: all_y, all_x, model_losses, n_initial_points\n\n    1.

            "description": "### Problem Analysis\nThe Dixon-Price function is a non-convex, multimodal function, which means it has multiple local minima, posing a challenge for optimization algorithms. The function's global minimum is at f(x) = 0 when x_i = 2^(-(2^i-2)/2) for i=1,2,..,n. It is also separable to some extent, meaning the function's variables are somewhat independent, although not entirely so due to the summation structure. The search space is a 6-dimensional hypercube with bounds [-10, 10] in each dimension, which is a moderately high dimensionality that can make exploration more difficult. The function is not particularly rugged, meaning that the gradient changes smoothly, but the presence of local minima poses the main challenge. The global minimum is at a specific location that may not be easily found through random sampling or gradient-based methods, thus requiring a strong exploration strategy.\n\n### Algorithm Design\nGiven the characteristics of the Dixon-Price function, a robust Bayesian Optimization strategy with a focus on exploration and efficient handling of multi-modality is required. Three strategies are considered with a trade-off between aggressiveness and performance. The chosen strategy will be implemented with AGGRESSIVENESS = 0.80.\n\n**Strategy 1: Standard Gaussian Process with Expected Improvement (Low Aggressiveness):**\n- **Surrogate Model**: Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) with a standard Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel, which is well-suited for approximating smooth functions.\n- **Acquisition Function**: Expected Improvement (EI), a classic acquisition function that balances exploration and exploitation.\n- **Sampling Strategy**: Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) for initial points and sequential optimization based on EI.\n- **Rationale**: This is a standard approach that is computationally efficient and works well for a variety of problems, providing a baseline performance.\n\n**Strategy 2: Gaussian Process with Thompson Sampling (Medium Aggressiveness):**\n- **Surrogate Model**: Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) with a Mat\u00e9rn kernel, which is more flexible than the RBF kernel and can handle non-smooth functions.\n- **Acquisition Function**: Thompson Sampling (TS), which samples from the posterior distribution of the objective function, promoting better exploration.\n- **Sampling Strategy**:  Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) for initial points and sequential optimization using TS.\n- **Rationale**: Thompson Sampling provides a more probabilistic approach to exploration compared to EI, which may be beneficial for multi-modal functions.\n\n**Strategy 3: Deep Ensemble Gaussian Process with Integrated Thompson Sampling (High Aggressiveness):**\n- **Surrogate Model**: Deep Ensemble Gaussian Process (DEGP), where several GP models are trained on the data with different initializations and kernels. The ensemble prediction is used for better approximation of the uncertainty and the objective function.\n- **Acquisition Function**: Integrated Thompson Sampling (ITS), where the samples from the posterior are collected from all models in the ensemble.\n- **Sampling Strategy**: A Sobol sequence for initial points to ensure a better space-filling property, and ITS is used for subsequent points.\n- **Rationale**: This strategy is designed to address the multi-modality and high dimensionality more effectively than the others. Deep Ensembles provide a better estimate of the uncertainty, and ITS provides better exploration by sampling from the ensemble.\n\n**Chosen Strategy (High Aggressiveness, 0.80):**\nBased on the analysis and the need for exploration, Strategy 3 is chosen with some modifications to balance computational cost and performance.\n- **Sampling Strategy**: A Sobol sequence is used for the initial 20% of the budget, as it has better space-filling properties than LHS, which is suitable for exploration in early stages. For the remaining iterations, sequential optimization with ITS is used. The budget will be split into 20% for initial points and 80% for iterations.\n- **Surrogate Model**: A Deep Ensemble Gaussian Process (DEGP) is used. We use two Gaussian Processes in the ensemble with RBF and Mat\u00e9rn kernels respectively. This approach leverages the strengths of both kernels and provides a robust estimate of the objective function and uncertainty.\n- **Metric**: The negative log-likelihood (NLL) is used to evaluate the surrogate model. NLL is a standard metric for evaluating the quality of probabilistic models.\n- **Acquisition Function**: Integrated Thompson Sampling (ITS) is used as the acquisition function, sampling from the posterior of each model in the ensemble and averaging the predictions for each candidate point. This ensures a better exploration of the search space.\n- **Hyperparameters**: The number of ensemble models will be 2. The length scale of the kernels in the Gaussian Processes will be optimized during the fitting of the surrogate model.\n\n**Other Possible Techniques:**\n- **Trust Region Methods:** Could be incorporated with the acquisition function to balance exploration and exploitation, focusing on promising areas while still exploring.\n- **Multi-Fidelity Optimization:** Could be used if a cheaper approximation of the objective function is available.\n- **Parallelization:** Could be used to evaluate multiple points concurrently, reducing the overall time.\n\n**Pseudocode:**\n```\nAlgorithm: DeepEnsembleThompsonBO\n\nInput: objective_fn, bounds, budget\nOutput: all_y, all_x, (model_losses, loss_name), n_initial_points\n\n1.  n_initial_points = 0.2 * budget\n2.  n_iterations = budget - n_initial_points\n3.  Initialize:\n    - Generate initial_X using Sobol sequence with n_initial_points\n    - Evaluate initial_y = objective_fn(initial_X)\n    - all_X = initial_X, all_y = initial_y\n    - model_losses = []\n4.  Fit Surrogate Model:\n    - Initialize a DEGP model with two GPR models (RBF and Matern kernel)\n    - Fit the DEGP model on all_X and all_y\n    - Evaluate model_loss using the negative log-likelihood\n    - Append model_loss to model_losses\n5.  for i = 1 to n_iterations:\n    - Acquisition Function (ITS):\n        - For each model in DEGP:\n            - Sample from the posterior distribution\n        - Calculate the average of the sampled values for each location\n        - Select the point X_next with the minimum value in ITS\n    - Evaluate y_next = objective_fn(X_next)\n    - Append X_next to all_X and y_next to all_y\n    - Fit Surrogate Model:\n        - Fit the DEGP model on all_X and all_y\n        - Evaluate model_loss using the negative log-likelihood\n        - Append model_loss to model_losses\n6.

The function's global minimum is at f(x) = 0 when x_i = 2^(-(2^i-2)/2) for i=1,2,..,n. It is also separable to some extent, meaning the function's variables are somewhat independent, although not entirely so due to the summation structure. The search space is a 6-dimensional hypercube with bounds [-10, 10] in each dimension, which is a moderately high dimensionality that can make exploration more difficult. The function is not particularly rugged, meaning that the gradient changes smoothly, but the presence of local minima poses the main challenge. The global minimum is at a specific location that may not be easily found through random sampling or gradient-based methods, thus requiring a strong exploration strategy.\n\n### Algorithm Design\nGiven the characteristics of the Dixon-Price function, a robust Bayesian Optimization strategy with a focus on exploration and efficient handling of multi-modality is required. Three strategies are considered with a trade-off between aggressiveness and performance. The chosen strategy will be implemented with AGGRESSIVENESS = 0.80.\n\n**Strategy 1: Standard Gaussian Process with Expected Improvement (Low Aggressiveness):**\n- **Surrogate Model**: Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) with a standard Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel, which is well-suited for approximating smooth functions.\n- **Acquisition Function**: Expected Improvement (EI), a classic acquisition function that balances exploration and exploitation.\n- **Sampling Strategy**: Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) for initial points and sequential optimization based on EI.\n- **Rationale**: This is a standard approach that is computationally efficient and works well for a variety of problems, providing a baseline performance.\n\n**Strategy 2: Gaussian Process with Thompson Sampling (Medium Aggressiveness):**\n- **Surrogate Model**: Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) with a Mat\u00e9rn kernel, which is more flexible than the RBF kernel and can handle non-smooth functions.\n- **Acquisition Function**: Thompson Sampling (TS), which samples from the posterior distribution of the objective function, promoting better exploration.\n- **Sampling Strategy**:  Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) for initial points and sequential optimization using TS.\n- **Rationale**: Thompson Sampling provides a more probabilistic approach to exploration compared to EI, which may be beneficial for multi-modal functions.\n\n**Strategy 3: Deep Ensemble Gaussian Process with Integrated Thompson Sampling (High Aggressiveness):**\n- **Surrogate Model**: Deep Ensemble Gaussian Process (DEGP), where several GP models are trained on the data with different initializations and kernels. The ensemble prediction is used for better approximation of the uncertainty and the objective function.\n- **Acquisition Function**: Integrated Thompson Sampling (ITS), where the samples from the posterior are collected from all models in the ensemble.\n- **Sampling Strategy**: A Sobol sequence for initial points to ensure a better space-filling property, and ITS is used for subsequent points.\n- **Rationale**: This strategy is designed to address the multi-modality and high dimensionality more effectively than the others. Deep Ensembles provide a better estimate of the uncertainty, and ITS provides better exploration by sampling from the ensemble.\n\n**Chosen Strategy (High Aggressiveness, 0.80):**\nBased on the analysis and the need for exploration, Strategy 3 is chosen with some modifications to balance computational cost and performance.\n- **Sampling Strategy**: A Sobol sequence is used for the initial 20% of the budget, as it has better space-filling properties than LHS, which is suitable for exploration in early stages. For the remaining iterations, sequential optimization with ITS is used. The budget will be split into 20% for initial points and 80% for iterations.\n- **Surrogate Model**: A Deep Ensemble Gaussian Process (DEGP) is used. We use two Gaussian Processes in the ensemble with RBF and Mat\u00e9rn kernels respectively. This approach leverages the strengths of both kernels and provides a robust estimate of the objective function and uncertainty.\n- **Metric**: The negative log-likelihood (NLL) is used to evaluate the surrogate model. NLL is a standard metric for evaluating the quality of probabilistic models.\n- **Acquisition Function**: Integrated Thompson Sampling (ITS) is used as the acquisition function, sampling from the posterior of each model in the ensemble and averaging the predictions for each candidate point. This ensures a better exploration of the search space.\n- **Hyperparameters**: The number of ensemble models will be 2. The length scale of the kernels in the Gaussian Processes will be optimized during the fitting of the surrogate model.\n\n**Other Possible Techniques:**\n- **Trust Region Methods:** Could be incorporated with the acquisition function to balance exploration and exploitation, focusing on promising areas while still exploring.\n- **Multi-Fidelity Optimization:** Could be used if a cheaper approximation of the objective function is available.\n- **Parallelization:** Could be used to evaluate multiple points concurrently, reducing the overall time.\n\n**Pseudocode:**\n```\nAlgorithm: DeepEnsembleThompsonBO\n\nInput: objective_fn, bounds, budget\nOutput: all_y, all_x, (model_losses, loss_name), n_initial_points\n\n1.  n_initial_points = 0.2 * budget\n2.  n_iterations = budget - n_initial_points\n3.  Initialize:\n    - Generate initial_X using Sobol sequence with n_initial_points\n    - Evaluate initial_y = objective_fn(initial_X)\n    - all_X = initial_X, all_y = initial_y\n    - model_losses = []\n4.  Fit Surrogate Model:\n    - Initialize a DEGP model with two GPR models (RBF and Matern kernel)\n    - Fit the DEGP model on all_X and all_y\n    - Evaluate model_loss using the negative log-likelihood\n    - Append model_loss to model_losses\n5.  for i = 1 to n_iterations:\n    - Acquisition Function (ITS):\n        - For each model in DEGP:\n            - Sample from the posterior distribution\n        - Calculate the average of the sampled values for each location\n        - Select the point X_next with the minimum value in ITS\n    - Evaluate y_next = objective_fn(X_next)\n    - Append X_next to all_X and y_next to all_y\n    - Fit Surrogate Model:\n        - Fit the DEGP model on all_X and all_y\n        - Evaluate model_loss using the negative log-likelihood\n        - Append model_loss to model_losses\n6.  Return all_y, all_X, (model_losses, \"negative log-likelihood\"), n_initial_points\n```\n### /Description\n\n### Code\n```python\nfrom typing import Callable\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.stats import qmc\nimport torch\nimport gpytorch\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\nfrom botorch.models import SingleTaskGP\nfrom botorch.fit import fit_gpytorch_model\nfrom gpytorch.mlls import ExactMarginalLogLikelihood\nfrom botorch.acquisition import PosteriorMean\nfrom botorch.optim import optimize_acqf\nfrom botorch.sampling import SobolQMCSampler\n\nclass DeepEnsembleThompsonBO:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.n_ensemble = 2\n        self.scaler_X = StandardScaler()\n        self.scaler_y = StandardScaler()\n        self.device = torch.device(\"cuda\" if torch.cuda.is_available() else \"cpu\")\n        self.models = []\n        self.likelihoods = []\n    \n    def _sample_points(self, n_points, bounds):\n        sampler = qmc.Sobol(d=bounds.shape[1], scramble=True)\n        sample = sampler.random(n_points)\n        return qmc.scale(sample, bounds[0], bounds[1])\n    \n    def _fit_model(self, X, y):\n        X_scaled = self.scaler_X.fit_transform(X)\n        y_scaled = self.scaler_y.fit_transform(y)\n        X_tensor = torch.tensor(X_scaled, dtype=torch.float32).to(self.device)\n        y_tensor = torch.tensor(y_scaled, dtype=torch.float32).reshape(-1).to(self.device)\n        \n        self.models = []\n        self.likelihoods = []\n        \n        for i in range(self.n_ensemble):\n            if i % 2 == 0: # RBF kernel\n                kernel = gpytorch.kernels.ScaleKernel(gpytorch.kernels.RBFKernel())\n            else:  # Matern kernel\n                kernel = gpytorch.kernels.ScaleKernel(gpytorch.kernels.MaternKernel())\n                \n            likelihood = gpytorch.likelihoods.GaussianLikelihood().to(self.device)\n            model = SingleTaskGP(X_tensor, y_tensor.reshape(-1,1), likelihood=likelihood,covar_module=kernel).to(self.device)\n            \n            mll = ExactMarginalLogLikelihood(model.likelihood, model)\n            fit_gpytorch_model(mll)\n            self.models.append(model)\n            self.likelihoods.append(likelihood)\n        \n        with torch.no_grad():\n            nll = 0\n            for model, likelihood in zip(self.models, self.likelihoods):\n                mll = ExactMarginalLogLikelihood(likelihood, model)\n                nll += -mll(model(X_tensor), y_tensor.reshape(-1,1)).item()\n            return nll/self.n_ensemble\n\n    def _acquisition_function(self, X):\n        X_scaled = self.scaler_X.transform(X)\n        X_tensor = torch.tensor(X_scaled, dtype=torch.float32).to(self.device)\n\n        posterior_samples = []\n        for model in self.models:\n            with torch.no_grad():\n                posterior = model.posterior(X_tensor)\n                samples = posterior.sample(sample_shape=torch.Size([1]))\n                posterior_samples.append(samples)\n        \n        avg_posterior_samples = torch.mean(torch.stack(posterior_samples), dim=0)\n        return avg_posterior_samples.squeeze().cpu().numpy()\n\n    def optimize(self, objective_fn: Callable[[np.ndarray], np.ndarray], bounds: np.ndarray, budget: int) -> tuple[np.ndarray, np.ndarray, tuple[np.ndarray, str], int]:\n        self.n_initial_points = int(0.2 * budget)\n        self.n_iterations = budget - self.n_initial_points\n        \n        initial_X = self._sample_points(self.n_initial_points, bounds)\n        initial_y = objective_fn(initial_X)\n        all_X = initial_X\n        all_y = initial_y\n        model_losses = []\n        \n        model_loss = self._fit_model(all_X, all_y)\n        model_losses.append(model_loss)\n        \n        for i in range(self.n_iterations):\n            acq_values = self._acquisition_function(all_X)\n            \n            best_idx = np.argmin(acq_values)\n            X_next_initial = all_X[best_idx].reshape(1,-1)\n            \n            acq_func = lambda x: -self._acquisition_function(x.reshape(1,-1))\n            \n            X_next, _ = optimize_acqf(\n                acq_function=PosteriorMean(self.models[0]),\n                bounds=torch.tensor(bounds.T, dtype=torch.float32).to(self.device),\n                q=1,\n                num_restarts=5,\n                raw_samples=20,\n            )\n            \n            X_next = X_next.cpu().numpy().reshape(1,-1)\n            y_next = objective_fn(X_next)\n            all_X = np.vstack((all_X, X_next))\n            all_y = np.vstack((all_y, y_next))\n            \n            model_loss = self._fit_model(all_X, all_y)\n            model_losses.append(model_loss)\n        \n        return all_y, all_X, (np.array(model_losses), \"negative log-likelihood\"), self.n_initial_points\n```\n### /Code\n",

The low-discrepancy property of Sobol is well-suited for initial exploration. For subsequent iterations, I will rely on the acquisition function for point selection.\n*   **Budget Strategy**: I will use 10% of the budget for initial points and the remaining 90% for iterations. This will allow for a good initial exploration while leaving enough budget for iterative optimization.\n\n**2. Surrogate Model:**\n\n*   **Comparison:**\n    *   **Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) with RBF kernel:** A standard choice, but can struggle with highly non-stationary functions and may oversimplify complex landscapes.\n    *   **GPR with Mat\u00e9rn kernel:** More flexible than RBF, allowing for control over the smoothness of the function and better adapt to functions with different levels of differentiability,\n    *   **Deep Kernel Learning (DKL):** Combines the expressiveness of deep neural networks with the uncertainty quantification of GPs. Can be more effective for complex functions, but is computationally more expensive.\n*   **Choice:** I will use **GPR with the Mat\u00e9rn kernel**, specifically the Mat\u00e9rn-5/2 kernel, as it offers a good balance between smoothness and flexibility. It is more adaptable to the ruggedness of the Holder Table function compared to the RBF kernel. Additionally, the computational cost is lower than DKL.\n*   **Metric**: I will use **Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL)** as the metric to evaluate and tune the surrogate model. NLL is a common metric for Gaussian processes and provides a measure of how well the model fits the observed data, taking into account the uncertainty.\n\n**3. Acquisition Function:**\n\n*   **Comparison:**\n    *   **Expected Improvement (EI):** A standard acquisition function that balances exploration and exploitation, but can get trapped in local optima, especially in multi-modal landscapes.\n    *   **Probability of Improvement (PI):** Similar to EI but tends to be more exploitative.\n    *   **Upper Confidence Bound (UCB):** Balances exploration and exploitation by considering the uncertainty of the predictions, but can be sensitive to the choice of the exploration-exploitation parameter.\n    *   **Thompson Sampling:** A probabilistic acquisition function that samples from the posterior distribution of the objective function, which is particularly well suited for exploration, and can be more robust in multi-modal landscapes.\n*   **Choice:** I will use **Thompson Sampling (TS)** due to its strong exploration capabilities and ability to handle multi-modality. TS naturally explores by sampling from the posterior distribution, which avoids the need for a hyperparameter to tune the exploration-exploitation balance.\n*   **Hyperparameters:** The Mat\u00e9rn kernel's length scale and variance will be optimized using a marginal likelihood maximization. Thompson sampling does not have a hyperparameter.\n\n**4. Other Possible Techniques:**\n\n*   **Multi-start Optimization:** Initialize the optimization from multiple points to increase the likelihood of finding the global minimum. However, this is not particularly suitable for BO, which is designed for sequential optimization.\n*   **Trust Region Methods:** Limit the search space around the current best point. However, this can lead to getting stuck in local optima with the Holder function.\n*   **Ensemble of Surrogate Models:** Use an ensemble of multiple surrogate models, each trained on different subsets of data or using different hyperparameters, to improve the robustness and accuracy of the predictions. However, this adds complexity and computational cost.\n\n**5.

This makes it hard to optimize each dimension independently.\n3.  **Oscillatory Behavior:** The sine and cosine components result in oscillatory behaviour, leading to many local extrema and a rugged landscape.\n4.  **Symmetry:** The four global minima are symmetrically located, which might be exploited by an algorithm.\n5. **Curvature:** The exponential term introduces significant curvature changes which increase the complexity of the optimization landscape.\n\nThese characteristics make the Holder Table function a good benchmark for evaluating the exploration and exploitation capabilities of optimization algorithms.

            "description": "**Problem Analysis**\n\nThe Michalewicz function is a challenging benchmark optimization problem known for its multi-modality and non-separability. Here's a breakdown of its characteristics:\n\n*   **Multi-modality:** It has many local minima, which can easily trap optimization algorithms, making it difficult to find the global minimum. The number of local minima increases with the dimensionality, making higher dimensions particularly difficult.\n*   **Non-Separability:** The variables are interdependent. This means that optimizing one variable independently of the others will likely not lead to the global optimum.\n*   **Ruggedness:** The function has a complex landscape with sharp peaks and valleys, which can cause gradient-based methods to struggle.\n*   **Dimensionality:** The problem instance in this case is 6-dimensional, which adds to the challenge.\n*   **Location of Global Minimum:** The global minimum is difficult to locate analytically and its location depends on the dimensionality.\n\nThese characteristics make the Michalewicz function a good test case for Bayesian Optimization (BO) algorithms, as BO is designed to handle non-convex, noisy, and expensive-to-evaluate functions. The key challenge will be finding the right balance between exploration (searching new areas of the search space) and exploitation (refining the search around promising areas) in this complex landscape.\n\n**Algorithm Design**\n\nGiven the problem characteristics, we will design a Bayesian Optimization algorithm with the following strategies:\n\n*   **Aggressiveness:** 0.80, meaning a preference for more advanced strategies, aiming for a good balance between exploration and exploitation.\n*   **Sampling Strategy:**\n    *   **Comparison:** Random sampling is the simplest, but can be inefficient. Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) provides better coverage of the search space than random sampling. Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods such as Sobol sequences offer even better space-filling properties and lower discrepancy, especially in moderate dimensions.\n    *   **Choice:** We will use a Sobol sequence for initial sampling because it has good space-filling properties and is more efficient than random or LHS, especially in moderate dimensions. For subsequent iterations, we will use the acquisition function to select the next point.\n    *   **Justification:** Sobol sequences provide a more uniform coverage of the search space, which helps the initial samples to be more informative, leading to a better surrogate model early on in the optimization process.\n*   **Initial Points and Iterations:**\n    *   **Strategy:** We will allocate 20% of the budget to initial points and 80% to iterations, aiming for a well-informed initial model and sufficient iterations to converge.\n    *   **Justification:** This approach provides a reasonable starting point with enough samples to fit the surrogate model and allows for a decent number of iterations for the optimization process.\n*   **Surrogate Model:**\n    *   **Comparison:** Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) with common kernels like RBF or Mat\u00e9rn is a standard choice. However, these kernels can struggle with highly multimodal functions. Deep Gaussian Process (DGP) can potentially capture more complex relationships in the data. However, they are computationally more expensive.\n    *   **Choice:** We will use a Gaussian Process (GP) with a Mat\u00e9rn 5/2 kernel. We will also use a custom likelihood function that adds some small noise to the predicted variance to prevent numerical instability.\n    *   **Justification:** Mat\u00e9rn 5/2 kernel is less sensitive to hyperparameters and offers more flexibility than RBF. Adding noise to the predicted variance in the likelihood function improves the robustness of the optimization.\n*   **Metric:**\n    *   **Choice:** We will use the negative log-likelihood of the observed data under the fitted GP model.\n    *   **Justification:** This metric directly assesses the quality of the model fit and is a standard way to assess the performance of a Gaussian Process.\n*   **Acquisition Function:**\n    *   **Comparison:** Expected Improvement (EI), Probability of Improvement (PI), and Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) are common choices. However, they can be prone to getting stuck in local optima. Thompson Sampling offers a more robust exploration strategy.\n    *   **Choice:** We will use Thompson Sampling.\n    *   **Justification:** Thompson Sampling is known for its strong exploration properties, which are beneficial in multimodal landscapes. It samples a function from the posterior and takes the minimum of that function, which helps to avoid local optima.\n*   **Hyperparameters:**\n    *   The Mat\u00e9rn kernel will have a length scale hyperparameter that will be optimized during the model fitting.\n    *   The Thompson Sampling will be based on the posterior distribution of the GP.\n    *   The noise added to the variance will be set to a small value, e.g. 1e-6.\n*   **Other Possible Techniques:**\n    *   **Multistart:** Run the optimization multiple times with different initial points.

                "raw_response": "### Description\n**Problem Analysis**\n\nThe Michalewicz function is a challenging benchmark optimization problem known for its multi-modality and non-separability. Here's a breakdown of its characteristics:\n\n*   **Multi-modality:** It has many local minima, which can easily trap optimization algorithms, making it difficult to find the global minimum. The number of local minima increases with the dimensionality, making higher dimensions particularly difficult.\n*   **Non-Separability:** The variables are interdependent. This means that optimizing one variable independently of the others will likely not lead to the global optimum.\n*   **Ruggedness:** The function has a complex landscape with sharp peaks and valleys, which can cause gradient-based methods to struggle.\n*   **Dimensionality:** The problem instance in this case is 6-dimensional, which adds to the challenge.\n*   **Location of Global Minimum:** The global minimum is difficult to locate analytically and its location depends on the dimensionality.\n\nThese characteristics make the Michalewicz function a good test case for Bayesian Optimization (BO) algorithms, as BO is designed to handle non-convex, noisy, and expensive-to-evaluate functions. The key challenge will be finding the right balance between exploration (searching new areas of the search space) and exploitation (refining the search around promising areas) in this complex landscape.\n\n**Algorithm Design**\n\nGiven the problem characteristics, we will design a Bayesian Optimization algorithm with the following strategies:\n\n*   **Aggressiveness:** 0.80, meaning a preference for more advanced strategies, aiming for a good balance between exploration and exploitation.\n*   **Sampling Strategy:**\n    *   **Comparison:** Random sampling is the simplest, but can be inefficient. Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) provides better coverage of the search space than random sampling. Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods such as Sobol sequences offer even better space-filling properties and lower discrepancy, especially in moderate dimensions.\n    *   **Choice:** We will use a Sobol sequence for initial sampling because it has good space-filling properties and is more efficient than random or LHS, especially in moderate dimensions. For subsequent iterations, we will use the acquisition function to select the next point.\n    *   **Justification:** Sobol sequences provide a more uniform coverage of the search space, which helps the initial samples to be more informative, leading to a better surrogate model early on in the optimization process.\n*   **Initial Points and Iterations:**\n    *   **Strategy:** We will allocate 20% of the budget to initial points and 80% to iterations, aiming for a well-informed initial model and sufficient iterations to converge.\n    *   **Justification:** This approach provides a reasonable starting point with enough samples to fit the surrogate model and allows for a decent number of iterations for the optimization process.\n*   **Surrogate Model:**\n    *   **Comparison:** Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) with common kernels like RBF or Mat\u00e9rn is a standard choice. However, these kernels can struggle with highly multimodal functions. Deep Gaussian Process (DGP) can potentially capture more complex relationships in the data. However, they are computationally more expensive.\n    *   **Choice:** We will use a Gaussian Process (GP) with a Mat\u00e9rn 5/2 kernel. We will also use a custom likelihood function that adds some small noise to the predicted variance to prevent numerical instability.\n    *   **Justification:** Mat\u00e9rn 5/2 kernel is less sensitive to hyperparameters and offers more flexibility than RBF. Adding noise to the predicted variance in the likelihood function improves the robustness of the optimization.\n*   **Metric:**\n    *   **Choice:** We will use the negative log-likelihood of the observed data under the fitted GP model.\n    *   **Justification:** This metric directly assesses the quality of the model fit and is a standard way to assess the performance of a Gaussian Process.\n*   **Acquisition Function:**\n    *   **Comparison:** Expected Improvement (EI), Probability of Improvement (PI), and Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) are common choices. However, they can be prone to getting stuck in local optima. Thompson Sampling offers a more robust exploration strategy.\n    *   **Choice:** We will use Thompson Sampling.\n    *   **Justification:** Thompson Sampling is known for its strong exploration properties, which are beneficial in multimodal landscapes. It samples a function from the posterior and takes the minimum of that function, which helps to avoid local optima.\n*   **Hyperparameters:**\n    *   The Mat\u00e9rn kernel will have a length scale hyperparameter that will be optimized during the model fitting.\n    *   The Thompson Sampling will be based on the posterior distribution of the GP.\n    *   The noise added to the variance will be set to a small value, e.g. 1e-6.\n*   **Other Possible Techniques:**\n    *   **Multistart:** Run the optimization multiple times with different initial points. This could help to find the global minimum more consistently.\n    *   **Parallelization:** Evaluate multiple points in parallel during the optimization step to speed up the process.\n*   **Pseudocode:**\n    ```\n    Algorithm: ThompsonSamplingBO\n    Input: objective_fn, bounds, budget\n    Output: all_y, all_x, model_losses, n_initial_points\n    \n    1.

            "description": "### Problem Analysis\nThe Eggholder function is a highly multimodal, non-separable, and challenging optimization problem. It features numerous local minima and a single global minimum, making it difficult for optimization algorithms to converge to the global optimum. The function's rugged landscape, characterized by steep valleys and plateaus, further complicates the search process. The two-dimensional nature of the problem, while not high-dimensional, still requires careful exploration and exploitation strategies to avoid getting trapped in local optima. The global minimum is located at (512, 404.2319), with a value of -959.6407. Its non-convexity and the presence of many local minima make it a good test case for evaluating the performance of global optimization algorithms.\n### Algorithm Design\n**Bayesian Optimization Strategies:**\n\nBased on the problem analysis, I propose and compare three Bayesian Optimization strategies with different levels of aggressiveness:\n\n1.  **Standard Gaussian Process with Expected Improvement (Low Aggressiveness):** This approach uses a standard Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) with a Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel as the surrogate model and Expected Improvement (EI) as the acquisition function. This is a well-established and relatively safe approach suitable for general problems. It balances exploration and exploitation but may struggle with the high multimodality of the Eggholder function.\n2.  **Gaussian Process with Thompson Sampling (Medium Aggressiveness):** This strategy also uses a GPR with an RBF kernel. However, instead of EI, it employs Thompson Sampling (TS) as the acquisition function. TS is known for its good exploration properties and can be more effective in multimodal landscapes. It samples from the posterior distribution, which can provide a more diverse set of points compared to EI.\n3.  **Deep Kernel Learning with Thompson Sampling (High Aggressiveness):** This strategy uses a Deep Kernel Learning (DKL) model as the surrogate model. DKL leverages a neural network to learn a feature representation and then uses a Gaussian Process on top of those features. This approach can capture more complex relationships in the data and is expected to be more robust on the multimodal landscape. We will use Thompson Sampling as acquisition function.\n\nGiven the AGGRESSIVENESS of 0.80, I will choose the third strategy for implementation: **Deep Kernel Learning with Thompson Sampling**\n\n**Detailed Algorithm Design:**\n\n*   **Sampling Strategy:** Instead of using simple random sampling for initial points, we will use a Sobol sequence from `scipy.stats.qmc`. Sobol sequences provide better space-filling properties and can improve the initial exploration of the search space. For the subsequent iterations, Thompson Sampling inherently provides a sampling strategy.\n*   **Budget Allocation:** For a given budget, we will allocate a portion for initial points and the rest for iterations. A reasonable strategy is to set the number of initial points equal to `2 * dimension + 1` in our case 5, and the rest of the budget for optimization iterations. This balances initial exploration with subsequent iterations.\n*  **Surrogate Model:** We will use Deep Kernel Learning (DKL) as the surrogate model. DKL uses a neural network to learn a feature representation of the input data, which is then fed into a Gaussian process. This allows the model to capture complex relationships in the data, potentially leading to better predictions in the multimodal landscape of the Eggholder function. The advantage of DKL is that it can model complex functions better than standard GPR, especially when non-linear relationships are present.\n*   **Metric:** We will use the negative log-likelihood (NLL) as the metric to evaluate the model. NLL is a standard metric for evaluating probabilistic models like Gaussian Processes. It measures the quality of the model's predictions by penalizing incorrect predictions with high confidence.\n*   **Acquisition Function:** We will use Thompson Sampling (TS) as the acquisition function. TS samples from the posterior distribution of the surrogate model, which is then used to select the next point to evaluate. TS is known to balance exploration and exploitation effectively, especially in multimodal landscapes. It provides a more diverse set of sample points than EI, which can be beneficial in the presence of multiple local minima.\n*   **Hyperparameters:**\n    *   **DKL Neural Network Architecture:** A simple two-layer neural network with 32 hidden units each.\n    *   **Learning Rate:** 0.01 with Adam optimizer.\n    *   **Number of Training Epochs:** 100 for DKL model.\n    *   **Thompson Sampling:** We use the posterior mean and variance to sample from the posterior distribution.\n*   **Other Possible Techniques:** We can consider adding a trust region or adaptive lengthscale for the Gaussian process to improve the performance, especially when the function has large variations in its gradients. However, these are not included in this version for simplicity and the focus on DKL and TS.\n\n**Pseudocode:**\n\n```\nAlgorithm: DeepKernelThompsonBO\n\nInput:\n    objective_fn: Function to be minimized\n    bounds: Search space bounds\n    budget: Total number of function evaluations\n\n1.

            "description": "### Problem Analysis\nThe Beale function is a two-dimensional, non-convex function with a single global minimum and several local minima. It is defined as:\n$$f(x, y) = (1.5 - x + xy)^2 + (2.25 - x + xy^2)^2 + (2.625 - x + xy^3)^2$$\nKey Characteristics:\n- Multi-modality: The presence of multiple local minima makes it challenging for optimization algorithms to converge to the global minimum.\n- Non-separability: The interaction between x and y variables (xy, xy^2, xy^3) means that the function cannot be optimized by independently optimizing each variable.\n- Ruggedness: The function's landscape has steep gradients and flat regions, making it difficult for gradient-based methods and some stochastic methods to efficiently navigate.\n- Global Minimum: The global minimum is located at (3, 0.5), with a function value of 0.\n- Dimensionality: Low dimensionality (2D) allows for visualization and easier sampling, but the local optima still pose a significant challenge for optimization.\n- Search Space: The given search space is [-4.5, 4.5] for both x and y, which is a relatively large area to explore.\n\nChallenges for Optimization Algorithms:\n- The presence of multiple local minima can cause algorithms to get stuck, preventing them from reaching the global minimum.\n- The rugged landscape with steep gradients and flat areas can lead to slow convergence or oscillations around the minima.\n- The non-separability of the variables requires algorithms to effectively consider the interaction between x and y during optimization.\n- The relatively large search space can make it difficult for algorithms to efficiently explore and find the global minimum within the given budget.\n\n### Algorithm Design\n**Bayesian Optimization Strategies**\n\nBased on the problem analysis, I propose and compare the following three Bayesian Optimization strategies:\n\n1.  **Standard GP-EI (Low Aggressiveness):** This approach utilizes a Gaussian Process (GP) with a standard kernel (e.g., RBF) as the surrogate model and Expected Improvement (EI) as the acquisition function. It's a widely used and relatively robust approach, suitable as a baseline. It offers a good balance between exploration and exploitation.\n    *   **Pros:** Simplicity, robustness, and wide applicability.\n    *   **Cons:** May struggle with multi-modality and could get trapped in local optima.\n\n2.  **GP-TS with QMC sampling (Moderate Aggressiveness):** This approach uses a GP with a RBF kernel as the surrogate model, and Thompson Sampling (TS) as the acquisition function. TS is known for good exploration properties, especially in multimodal landscapes. To further enhance exploration and reduce clustering, a quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) method will be used for initial point sampling.\n    *   **Pros:** Improved exploration, good for multimodal problems, and less sensitive to local optima compared to EI.\n    *   **Cons:** Can be more stochastic, may require more iterations to find the global optimum, and the performance is affected by the quality of the QMC sampling.\n\n3.  **Deep Ensemble GP with Max-Value Entropy Search (High Aggressiveness):** This strategy employs an ensemble of Deep Kernel Gaussian Processes (DKGP) as the surrogate model, which allows to capture complex function structures and offers better uncertainty quantification than standard GP. The Max-Value Entropy Search (MES) acquisition function will be used, which aims to maximize the information gained about the location of the global optimum. In addition, a more efficient sequential sampling strategy would be employed.\n    *   **Pros:** Enhanced modeling of complex landscapes, better uncertainty estimates, and efficient exploration.\n    *   **Cons:** Computationally expensive, requires careful tuning, and can be overfitting if not handled correctly.\n\n**Chosen Strategy: GP-TS with QMC sampling (Moderate Aggressiveness)**\n\nGiven the moderate aggressiveness level (0.80), I will choose the **GP-TS with QMC sampling** strategy. It offers a good balance between exploration and exploitation, and is better suited for the multi-modal nature of the Beale function than the standard GP-EI. The computational cost is also more reasonable compared to the Deep Ensemble approach.\n\n**Detailed Algorithm Design:**\n\n*   **Sampling Strategy:**\n    *   **Comparison:**\n        *   Random sampling is simple but can be inefficient, leading to clustered points and poor coverage.\n        *   Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) provides better coverage than random sampling but is not as efficient as QMC for low-dimensional problems.\n        *   Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods, like Sobol sequences, are designed to achieve low discrepancy and cover the space more uniformly, which is beneficial for initial sampling in BO.\n    *   **Selection:** I will use a Sobol sequence from `scipy.stats.qmc` for the initial points. QMC methods provide a more uniform space-filling property than random or LHS, which is beneficial in exploring the entire search space.\n*   **Budget Allocation:** The budget will be split into `n_initial_points` and `n_iterations`.  I will choose the `n_initial_points` to be 2 * dimension, which is 4 in this case.\n*   **Surrogate Model:**\n    *   **Comparison:**\n        *   Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) with RBF kernel is standard and works well for many problems.\n        *   Deep Kernel Gaussian Processes (DKGP) can capture more complex relationships but are more computationally expensive.\n        *   Other kernels like Matern or linear kernels can be used depending on the problem characteristics.\n    *   **Selection:** I will use a standard GPR with an RBF kernel, as it's a good balance between performance and computational cost for this problem.\n    *   **Metric:** Negative log-likelihood (NLL) will be used to evaluate the model. NLL is a standard metric for probabilistic models like GP and allows the model to be tuned to fit the data well.\n*   **Acquisition Function:**\n    *   **Comparison:**\n        *   Expected Improvement (EI) is a common choice, but it can be greedy and prone to getting stuck in local optima.\n        *   Probability of Improvement (PI) is simpler but less effective than EI.\n        *   Thompson Sampling (TS) is a probabilistic approach that samples from the posterior distribution, which encourages exploration.\n    *   **Selection:** I will use Thompson Sampling (TS) for its good exploration properties and its ability to handle multi-modality.\n    *   **Hyperparameters:** No specific hyperparameters needed for this standard implementation of Thompson Sampling.\n*   **Other Techniques:**\n    *   **Batch Optimization:** Could be used to evaluate multiple points in parallel, but not necessary for this problem due to the low dimensionality.\n    *   **Trust Region:** Could help to improve convergence by limiting the search to a local region, but it adds complexity and may not be necessary.\n\n**Pseudocode:**\n\n```\nAlgorithm: GP-TS-QMC-BO\n\nInput: objective_fn, bounds, budget\nOutput: all_y, all_x, (model_losses, loss_name), n_initial_points\n\n1.

It is defined as:\n$$f(x, y) = (1.5 - x + xy)^2 + (2.25 - x + xy^2)^2 + (2.625 - x + xy^3)^2$$\nKey Characteristics:\n- Multi-modality: The presence of multiple local minima makes it challenging for optimization algorithms to converge to the global minimum.\n- Non-separability: The interaction between x and y variables (xy, xy^2, xy^3) means that the function cannot be optimized by independently optimizing each variable.\n- Ruggedness: The function's landscape has steep gradients and flat regions, making it difficult for gradient-based methods and some stochastic methods to efficiently navigate.\n- Global Minimum: The global minimum is located at (3, 0.5), with a function value of 0.\n- Dimensionality: Low dimensionality (2D) allows for visualization and easier sampling, but the local optima still pose a significant challenge for optimization.\n- Search Space: The given search space is [-4.5, 4.5] for both x and y, which is a relatively large area to explore.\n\nChallenges for Optimization Algorithms:\n- The presence of multiple local minima can cause algorithms to get stuck, preventing them from reaching the global minimum.\n- The rugged landscape with steep gradients and flat areas can lead to slow convergence or oscillations around the minima.\n- The non-separability of the variables requires algorithms to effectively consider the interaction between x and y during optimization.\n- The relatively large search space can make it difficult for algorithms to efficiently explore and find the global minimum within the given budget.\n\n### Algorithm Design\n**Bayesian Optimization Strategies**\n\nBased on the problem analysis, I propose and compare the following three Bayesian Optimization strategies:\n\n1.  **Standard GP-EI (Low Aggressiveness):** This approach utilizes a Gaussian Process (GP) with a standard kernel (e.g., RBF) as the surrogate model and Expected Improvement (EI) as the acquisition function. It's a widely used and relatively robust approach, suitable as a baseline. It offers a good balance between exploration and exploitation.\n    *   **Pros:** Simplicity, robustness, and wide applicability.\n    *   **Cons:** May struggle with multi-modality and could get trapped in local optima.\n\n2.  **GP-TS with QMC sampling (Moderate Aggressiveness):** This approach uses a GP with a RBF kernel as the surrogate model, and Thompson Sampling (TS) as the acquisition function. TS is known for good exploration properties, especially in multimodal landscapes. To further enhance exploration and reduce clustering, a quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) method will be used for initial point sampling.\n    *   **Pros:** Improved exploration, good for multimodal problems, and less sensitive to local optima compared to EI.\n    *   **Cons:** Can be more stochastic, may require more iterations to find the global optimum, and the performance is affected by the quality of the QMC sampling.\n\n3.  **Deep Ensemble GP with Max-Value Entropy Search (High Aggressiveness):** This strategy employs an ensemble of Deep Kernel Gaussian Processes (DKGP) as the surrogate model, which allows to capture complex function structures and offers better uncertainty quantification than standard GP. The Max-Value Entropy Search (MES) acquisition function will be used, which aims to maximize the information gained about the location of the global optimum. In addition, a more efficient sequential sampling strategy would be employed.\n    *   **Pros:** Enhanced modeling of complex landscapes, better uncertainty estimates, and efficient exploration.\n    *   **Cons:** Computationally expensive, requires careful tuning, and can be overfitting if not handled correctly.\n\n**Chosen Strategy: GP-TS with QMC sampling (Moderate Aggressiveness)**\n\nGiven the moderate aggressiveness level (0.80), I will choose the **GP-TS with QMC sampling** strategy. It offers a good balance between exploration and exploitation, and is better suited for the multi-modal nature of the Beale function than the standard GP-EI. The computational cost is also more reasonable compared to the Deep Ensemble approach.\n\n**Detailed Algorithm Design:**\n\n*   **Sampling Strategy:**\n    *   **Comparison:**\n        *   Random sampling is simple but can be inefficient, leading to clustered points and poor coverage.\n        *   Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) provides better coverage than random sampling but is not as efficient as QMC for low-dimensional problems.\n        *   Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods, like Sobol sequences, are designed to achieve low discrepancy and cover the space more uniformly, which is beneficial for initial sampling in BO.\n    *   **Selection:** I will use a Sobol sequence from `scipy.stats.qmc` for the initial points. QMC methods provide a more uniform space-filling property than random or LHS, which is beneficial in exploring the entire search space.\n*   **Budget Allocation:** The budget will be split into `n_initial_points` and `n_iterations`.  I will choose the `n_initial_points` to be 2 * dimension, which is 4 in this case.\n*   **Surrogate Model:**\n    *   **Comparison:**\n        *   Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) with RBF kernel is standard and works well for many problems.\n        *   Deep Kernel Gaussian Processes (DKGP) can capture more complex relationships but are more computationally expensive.\n        *   Other kernels like Matern or linear kernels can be used depending on the problem characteristics.\n    *   **Selection:** I will use a standard GPR with an RBF kernel, as it's a good balance between performance and computational cost for this problem.\n    *   **Metric:** Negative log-likelihood (NLL) will be used to evaluate the model. NLL is a standard metric for probabilistic models like GP and allows the model to be tuned to fit the data well.\n*   **Acquisition Function:**\n    *   **Comparison:**\n        *   Expected Improvement (EI) is a common choice, but it can be greedy and prone to getting stuck in local optima.\n        *   Probability of Improvement (PI) is simpler but less effective than EI.\n        *   Thompson Sampling (TS) is a probabilistic approach that samples from the posterior distribution, which encourages exploration.\n    *   **Selection:** I will use Thompson Sampling (TS) for its good exploration properties and its ability to handle multi-modality.\n    *   **Hyperparameters:** No specific hyperparameters needed for this standard implementation of Thompson Sampling.\n*   **Other Techniques:**\n    *   **Batch Optimization:** Could be used to evaluate multiple points in parallel, but not necessary for this problem due to the low dimensionality.\n    *   **Trust Region:** Could help to improve convergence by limiting the search to a local region, but it adds complexity and may not be necessary.\n\n**Pseudocode:**\n\n```\nAlgorithm: GP-TS-QMC-BO\n\nInput: objective_fn, bounds, budget\nOutput: all_y, all_x, (model_losses, loss_name), n_initial_points\n\n1.
