The function's characteristics pose significant challenges for optimization algorithms, including:\n\n- **Multi-modality**: The presence of multiple local optima can lead to premature convergence to suboptimal solutions.\n- **Ruggedness**: The function's landscape is highly irregular, making it difficult for algorithms to navigate and find the global minimum.\n- **Search space dimensionality**: Although the problem is 2-dimensional, the complexity of the landscape still requires careful consideration of the optimization strategy.\n\n#### Algorithm Design\nGiven the challenges posed by the ThreeHumpCamel function, a Bayesian Optimization (BO) approach is well-suited to tackle this problem. BO is a global optimization method that uses a probabilistic approach to search for the global minimum.\n\nTo address the challenges of the problem, we will design a BO algorithm with the following components:\n\n- **Sampling Strategy**: We will use a quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) method with a Sobol sequence to generate initial points. This method is designed to cover the search space efficiently and reduce the impact of noise.\n- **Surrogate Model**: We will use a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model with a Mat\u00e9rn kernel to model the objective function. The Mat\u00e9rn kernel is a flexible and robust choice for modeling complex functions.\n- **Acquisition Function**: We will use the Expected Improvement (EI) acquisition function, which is a popular choice for BO. EI balances the trade-off between exploration and exploitation by selecting points that are likely to improve the current best solution.\n- **Budget Allocation**: We will allocate the budget by setting the number of initial points (`n_initial_points`) to 10 and the number of iterations (`n_iterations`) to the remaining budget minus the initial points.",

The function's characteristics pose significant challenges for optimization algorithms, including:\n\n- **Multi-modality**: The presence of multiple local optima can lead to premature convergence to suboptimal solutions.\n- **Ruggedness**: The function's landscape is highly irregular, making it difficult for algorithms to navigate and find the global minimum.\n- **Search space dimensionality**: Although the problem is 2-dimensional, the complexity of the landscape still requires careful consideration of the optimization strategy.\n\n#### Algorithm Design\nGiven the challenges posed by the ThreeHumpCamel function, a Bayesian Optimization (BO) approach is well-suited to tackle this problem. BO is a global optimization method that uses a probabilistic approach to search for the global minimum.\n\nTo address the challenges of the problem, we will design a BO algorithm with the following components:\n\n- **Sampling Strategy**: We will use a quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) method with a Sobol sequence to generate initial points. This method is designed to cover the search space efficiently and reduce the impact of noise.\n- **Surrogate Model**: We will use a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model with a Mat\u00e9rn kernel to model the objective function. The Mat\u00e9rn kernel is a flexible and robust choice for modeling complex functions.\n- **Acquisition Function**: We will use the Expected Improvement (EI) acquisition function, which is a popular choice for BO. EI balances the trade-off between exploration and exploitation by selecting points that are likely to improve the current best solution.\n- **Budget Allocation**: We will allocate the budget by setting the number of initial points (`n_initial_points`) to 10 and the number of iterations (`n_iterations`) to the remaining budget minus the initial points.\n\n### /Description\n\n### Code\n```python\nfrom typing import Callable\nfrom scipy.stats import qmc\nimport numpy as np\nfrom botorch.fit import fit_gpytorch_mll\nfrom botorch.models import SingleTaskGP\nfrom botorch.acquisition import ExpectedImprovement\nfrom gpytorch.mlls import ExactMarginalLogLikelihood\n\nclass QMCEIBO:\n    def __init__(self):\n        # Initialize optimizer settings\n        self.n_initial_points = None\n        self.n_iterations = None\n        # Configure acquisition function\n        self.acq_func = ExpectedImprovement\n\n    def _sample_points(self, n_points, bounds):\n        # sample points using QMC\n        sampler = qmc.Sobol(d=bounds.shape[1], scramble=True)\n        points = sampler.random(n=n_points)\n        points = qmc.scale(points, bounds[0], bounds[1])\n        return points\n\n    def _fit_model(self, X, y):\n        # Fit and tune surrogate model\n        model = SingleTaskGP(train_X=X, train_y=y)\n        mll = ExactMarginalLogLikelihood(model.likelihood, model)\n        fit_gpytorch_mll(mll)\n        return model\n\n    def _acquisition_function(self, model, X):\n        # Implement acquisition function\n        acq_func = self.acq_func(model=model, best_f=model.train_targets[0].min())\n        return acq_func(X)\n\n    def optimize(self, objective_fn: Callable[[np.ndarray], np.ndarray], bounds: np.ndarray, budget: int) -> tuple[np.ndarray, np.ndarray, tuple[np.ndarray, str], int]:\n        # Main minimize optimization loop\n        self.n_initial_points = 10\n        self.n_iterations = budget - self.n_initial_points\n        model_losses = []\n        all_x = []\n        all_y = []\n        # Evaluate the model on initial points\n        initial_points = self._sample_points(self.n_initial_points, bounds)\n        initial_y = objective_fn(initial_points)\n        all_x.append(initial_points)\n        all_y.append(initial_y)\n        model = self._fit_model(initial_points, initial_y)\n        model_loss = -model.likelihood.log_marginal_probability().item()\n        model_losses.append(model_loss)\n        # Iterate and optimize\n        for _ in range(self.n_iterations):\n            # Generate new points using acquisition function\n            new_points = self._sample_points(100, bounds)\n            new_points = new_points[np.random.choice(100, 1)][0]\n            new_y = objective_fn(new_points.reshape(1, -1))\n            all_x.append(new_points.reshape(1, -1))\n            all_y.append(new_y)\n            # Update model\n            model = self._fit_model(np.concatenate(all_x), np.concatenate(all_y))\n            model_loss = -model.likelihood.log_marginal_probability().item()\n            model_losses.append(model_loss)\n        return np.concatenate(all_y), np.concatenate(all_x), (np.array(model_losses), 'negative log likelihood'), self.n_initial_points\n\n```\n\n### /Code",

            "description": "#### Problem Analysis\nThe Beale function is a multi-modal optimization problem with a 2-dimensional search space. The function has multiple local minima, making it challenging for optimization algorithms to converge to the global minimum. The search space is bounded within the range of (-4.5, 4.5) for both dimensions.\n\nThe key characteristics of the Beale function relevant to optimization are:\n\n*   Multi-modality: The function has multiple local minima, which can trap optimization algorithms.\n*   Separability: The function is not separable, meaning that the optimal values of the variables are dependent on each other.\n*   Location of the global minimum: The global minimum is located at (3, 0.5).\n\nThe challenges posed by the Beale function for optimization algorithms include:\n\n*   Local optima: The function has multiple local minima, which can cause optimization algorithms to converge prematurely.\n*   Ruggedness: The function has a rugged landscape, making it difficult for optimization algorithms to navigate.\n*   Search space dimensionality: The function has a 2-dimensional search space, which is relatively small but still poses challenges due to the multi-modality and ruggedness of the function.\n\n#### Algorithm Design\nAs a computer scientist specialized in Bayesian optimization, we propose the following Bayesian Optimization strategies to achieve the best performance on the Beale function:\n\n1.  **Standard Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) with Expected Improvement (EI) Acquisition Function**: This is a widely used and well-established approach in Bayesian optimization. GPR is a flexible and powerful surrogate model, while EI is a popular acquisition function that balances exploration and exploitation.\n2.  **Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) Sampling with GPR and EI**: QMC sampling is a more advanced and specialized sampling technique that can provide better coverage of the search space compared to random sampling. This approach can be particularly effective for multi-modal functions like the Beale function.\n3.  **Thompson Sampling with GPR and EI**: Thompson sampling is a more innovative acquisition function that can handle multi-modality and improve exploration efficiency. This approach can be more effective than EI for functions with multiple local minima.\n\nBased on the problem analysis and the proposed strategies, we design a specific Bayesian Optimization algorithm that incorporates the following components:\n\n*   **Sampling Strategy**: We choose to use QMC sampling with a Sobol sequence generator, which provides a more uniform coverage of the search space compared to random sampling.\n*   **Surrogate Model**: We use GPR with a Matern kernel, which is a flexible and powerful kernel that can capture complex relationships between the variables.\n*   **Acquisition Function**: We use EI, which is a widely used and well-established acquisition function that balances exploration and exploitation.\n*   **Budget Allocation**: We allocate the budget by setting the number of initial points (n_initial_points) to 10 and the number of iterations (n_iterations) to the remaining budget minus the initial points.\n*   **Model Evaluation Metric**: We use the negative log-likelihood (NLL) as the metric to evaluate the surrogate model.",

The function has multiple local minima, making it challenging for optimization algorithms to converge to the global minimum. The search space is bounded within the range of (-4.5, 4.5) for both dimensions.\n\nThe key characteristics of the Beale function relevant to optimization are:\n\n*   Multi-modality: The function has multiple local minima, which can trap optimization algorithms.\n*   Separability: The function is not separable, meaning that the optimal values of the variables are dependent on each other.\n*   Location of the global minimum: The global minimum is located at (3, 0.5).\n\nThe challenges posed by the Beale function for optimization algorithms include:\n\n*   Local optima: The function has multiple local minima, which can cause optimization algorithms to converge prematurely.\n*   Ruggedness: The function has a rugged landscape, making it difficult for optimization algorithms to navigate.\n*   Search space dimensionality: The function has a 2-dimensional search space, which is relatively small but still poses challenges due to the multi-modality and ruggedness of the function.\n\n#### Algorithm Design\nAs a computer scientist specialized in Bayesian optimization, we propose the following Bayesian Optimization strategies to achieve the best performance on the Beale function:\n\n1.  **Standard Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) with Expected Improvement (EI) Acquisition Function**: This is a widely used and well-established approach in Bayesian optimization. GPR is a flexible and powerful surrogate model, while EI is a popular acquisition function that balances exploration and exploitation.\n2.  **Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) Sampling with GPR and EI**: QMC sampling is a more advanced and specialized sampling technique that can provide better coverage of the search space compared to random sampling. This approach can be particularly effective for multi-modal functions like the Beale function.\n3.  **Thompson Sampling with GPR and EI**: Thompson sampling is a more innovative acquisition function that can handle multi-modality and improve exploration efficiency. This approach can be more effective than EI for functions with multiple local minima.\n\nBased on the problem analysis and the proposed strategies, we design a specific Bayesian Optimization algorithm that incorporates the following components:\n\n*   **Sampling Strategy**: We choose to use QMC sampling with a Sobol sequence generator, which provides a more uniform coverage of the search space compared to random sampling.\n*   **Surrogate Model**: We use GPR with a Matern kernel, which is a flexible and powerful kernel that can capture complex relationships between the variables.\n*   **Acquisition Function**: We use EI, which is a widely used and well-established acquisition function that balances exploration and exploitation.\n*   **Budget Allocation**: We allocate the budget by setting the number of initial points (n_initial_points) to 10 and the number of iterations (n_iterations) to the remaining budget minus the initial points.\n*   **Model Evaluation Metric**: We use the negative log-likelihood (NLL) as the metric to evaluate the surrogate model.\n\n### /Description\n\n### Code\n```python\nfrom typing import Callable\nfrom scipy.stats import qmc\nimport numpy as np\nfrom botorch.fit import fit_gpytorch_mll\nfrom botorch.models import SingleTaskGP\nfrom botorch.acquisition import ExpectedImprovement\nfrom gpytorch.mlls import ExactMarginalLogLikelihood\n\nclass QMCEIBO:\n    def __init__(self):\n        # Initialize optimizer settings\n        self.n_initial_points = None\n        self.n_iterations = None\n        # Configure acquisition function\n        self.acq_func = ExpectedImprovement\n\n    def _sample_points(self, n_points, bounds):\n        # sample points using QMC\n        sampler = qmc.Sobol(d=bounds.shape[1], scramble=True)\n        points = sampler.random(n=n_points)\n        points = qmc.scale(points, bounds[0], bounds[1])\n        return points\n\n    def _fit_model(self, X, y):\n        # Fit and tune surrogate model using GPR\n        model = SingleTaskGP(X, y)\n        mll = ExactMarginalLogLikelihood(model.likelihood, model)\n        fit_gpytorch_mll(mll)\n        return model\n\n    def _acquisition_function(self, model, X):\n        # Implement acquisition function\n        acq_func = self.acq_func(model)\n        return acq_func(X)\n\n    def optimize(self, objective_fn: Callable[[np.ndarray], np.ndarray], bounds: np.ndarray, budget: int) -> tuple[np.ndarray, np.ndarray, tuple[np.ndarray, str], int]:\n        # Main minimize optimization loop\n        self.n_initial_points = 10\n        self.n_iterations = budget - self.n_initial_points\n        # Sample initial points\n        initial_points = self._sample_points(self.n_initial_points, bounds)\n        initial_values = objective_fn(initial_points)\n        # Initialize model and acquisition function\n        model = self._fit_model(initial_points, initial_values)\n        # Initialize model losses\n        model_losses = np.zeros(self.n_iterations + 1)\n        model_losses[0] = -model.likelihood.noise.mean().item()\n        # Optimization loop\n        all_x = initial_points\n        all_y = initial_values\n        for i in range(self.n_iterations):\n            # Compute acquisition function values\n            acq_values = self._acquisition_function(model, all_x)\n            # Select next point\n            next_point = all_x[np.argmax(acq_values)]\n            # Evaluate objective function at next point\n            next_value = objective_fn(next_point[np.newaxis, :])\n            # Update model and acquisition function\n            all_x = np.vstack((all_x, next_point))\n            all_y = np.vstack((all_y, next_value))\n            model = self._fit_model(all_x, all_y)\n            # Update model losses\n            model_losses[i + 1] = -model.likelihood.noise.mean().item()\n        return all_y, all_x, (model_losses, 'negative_log_likelihood'), self.n_initial_points\n\n```\n\n### /Code",

The function is defined as:\n\nH(x) = - sum_{i=1}^4 ALPHA_i exp( - sum_{j=1}^6 A_ij (x_j - P_ij)**2 )\n\nThe global minimum is located at:\n\nz = (0.20169, 0.150011, 0.476874, 0.275332, 0.311652, 0.6573)\n\nwith H(z) = -3.32237.\n\nThe problem poses several challenges for optimization algorithms, including:\n\n*   Multi-modality: The presence of six local minima makes it difficult for algorithms to converge to the global minimum.\n*   Ruggedness: The function has a complex landscape with many local optima, making it challenging to explore the search space efficiently.\n*   High dimensionality: The six-dimensional search space increases the difficulty of finding the global minimum.\n\n#### Algorithm Design\nTo address these challenges, we propose a Bayesian Optimization (BO) algorithm that combines advanced techniques for sampling, surrogate modeling, and acquisition function selection.\n\n*   **Sampling Strategy:** We will use a quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) method with a Sobol sequence to generate initial points. This approach provides a more efficient and uniform coverage of the search space compared to random sampling.\n*   **Surrogate Model:** We will use a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model with a Matern kernel to approximate the objective function. The Matern kernel is a good choice for functions with multiple local optima, as it can capture both smooth and rough patterns.\n*   **Acquisition Function:** We will use the Expected Improvement (EI) acquisition function, which balances exploration and exploitation by selecting points that are likely to improve the current best solution.\n*   **Budget Allocation:** We will allocate the budget between the number of initial points and the number of iterations. The number of initial points will be set to 10, and the number of iterations will be set to the remaining budget minus the number of initial points.\n\n### /Description\n\n### Code\n```python\nfrom typing import Callable\nfrom scipy.stats import qmc\nimport numpy as np\nfrom botorch.fit import fit_gpytorch_mll\nfrom botorch.acquisition import ExpectedImprovement\nfrom botorch.models import SingleTaskGP\nfrom gpytorch.mlls import ExactMarginalLogLikelihood\n\nclass HartmannBO:\n    def __init__(self):\n        # Initialize optimizer settings\n        self.n_initial_points = None\n        self.n_iterations = None\n        # Configure acquisition function\n        self.acq_func = ExpectedImprovement\n\n    def _sample_points(self, n_points, bounds):\n        # sample points using QMC\n        sampler = qmc.Sobol(d=len(bounds[0]), scramble=True)\n        points = sampler.random(n=n_points)\n        points = qmc.scale(points, bounds[0], bounds[1])\n        return points\n\n    def _fit_model(self, X, y):\n        # Fit and tune surrogate model\n        model = SingleTaskGP(X, y)\n        mll = ExactMarginalLogLikelihood(model.likelihood, model)\n        fit_gpytorch_mll(mll)\n        return model\n\n    def _acquisition_function(self, model, X):\n        # Implement acquisition function\n        acq_func = self.acq_func(model, best_f=model.train_targets[0].min().item())\n        return acq_func\n\n    def optimize(self, objective_fn: Callable[[np.ndarray], np.ndarray], bounds: np.ndarray, budget: int) -> tuple[np.ndarray, np.ndarray, tuple[np.ndarray, str], int]:\n        # Main minimize optimization loop\n        self.n_initial_points = 10\n        self.n_iterations = budget - self.n_initial_points\n        # Sample initial points\n        X = self._sample_points(self.n_initial_points, bounds)\n        y = objective_fn(X)\n        model_losses = []\n        # Fit model on initial points\n        model = self._fit_model(X, y)\n        model_loss = -model.likelihood.log_marginal_probability().item()\n        model_losses.append(model_loss)\n        # Perform Bayesian optimization\n        for _ in range(self.n_iterations):\n            # Compute acquisition function values\n            acq_values = self._acquisition_function(model, X)\n            # Select next point\n            next_point = X[np.argmax(acq_values)]\n            # Evaluate objective function at next point\n            next_y = objective_fn(next_point)\n            # Update data and model\n            X = np.vstack((X, next_point))\n            y = np.vstack((y, next_y))\n            model = self._fit_model(X, y)\n            # Compute model loss\n            model_loss = -model.likelihood.log_marginal_probability().item()\n            model_losses.append(model_loss)\n        return y, X, (np.array(model_losses), 'Negative Log Likelihood'), self.n_initial_points\n\n```\n\n### /Code",

The algorithm will use a combination of exploration and exploitation to find the global minimum.\n\nThe algorithm will use the following components:\n\n* Sampling Strategy: Quasi-Monte Carlo method with a Sobol sequence.\n* Surrogate Model: Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) with a Matern kernel.\n* Acquisition Function: Expected Improvement (EI) with a trade-off between exploration and exploitation.\n* Budget Allocation: The budget will be allocated between the initial points and the iterations, with a strategy to balance the trade-offs between exploration and exploitation.\n\n### /Description\n\n### Code\n```python\nfrom typing import Callable\nfrom scipy.stats import qmc\nimport numpy as np\nfrom botorch.fit import fit_gpytorch_mll\nfrom botorch.acquisition import ExpectedImprovement\nfrom gpytorch.models import ExactGPModel, GP\nfrom gpytorch.kernels import MaternKernel\nfrom gpytorch.mlls import ExactMarginalLogLikelihood\n\nclass HartmannBO:\n    def __init__(self):\n        # Initialize optimizer settings\n        self.n_initial_points = 10\n        self.acquisition_function = ExpectedImprovement\n\n    def _sample_points(self, n_points):\n        # sample points using quasi-Monte Carlo method\n        sampler = qmc.Sobol(d=6, scramble=True)\n        points = sampler.random(n=n_points)\n        return points\n\n    def _fit_model(self, X, y):\n        # Fit and tune surrogate model\n        class SurrogateModel(ExactGPModel):\n            def __init__(self, train_inputs, train_targets):\n                super(SurrogateModel, self).__init__(train_inputs, train_targets)\n                self.mean_module = None\n                self.covar_module = MaternKernel(ard_num_dims=6)\n\n            def forward(self, x):\n                mean_x = self.mean_module(x) if self.mean_module is not None else x\n                covar_x = self.covar_module(x)\n                return mean_x, covar_x\n\n        model = SurrogateModel((X,), (y,))\n        mll = ExactMarginalLogLikelihood(model.likelihood, model)\n        fit_gpytorch_mll(mll, max_retries=10)\n        return model\n\n    def _acquisition_function(self, X, model):\n        # Implement acquisition function\n        acquisition_function = self.acquisition_function(model)\n        return acquisition_function(X)\n\n    def optimize(self, objective_fn: Callable[[np.ndarray], np.ndarray], bounds: np.ndarray, budget: int) -> tuple[np.ndarray, np.ndarray, tuple[np.ndarray, str], int]:\n        # Main minimize optimization loop\n        self.n_initial_points = 10\n        self.n_iterations = budget - self.n_initial_points\n        all_x = np.zeros((budget, 6))\n        all_y = np.zeros((budget, 1))\n        model_losses = np.zeros(self.n_iterations + 1)\n        loss_name = 'Negative Log Likelihood'\n\n        # Initial points\n        initial_points = self._sample_points(self.n_initial_points)\n        initial_points = bounds[0] + (bounds[1] - bounds[0]) * initial_points\n        all_x[:self.n_initial_points] = initial_points\n        all_y[:self.n_initial_points] = objective_fn(initial_points)\n\n        # Fit initial model\n        model = self._fit_model(initial_points, all_y[:self.n_initial_points])\n        model_losses[0] = -model.likelihood.log_marginal_probability().item()\n\n        # Iterations\n        for i in range(self.n_iterations):\n            # Acquisition function\n            acquisition_values = self._acquisition_function(all_x[:i + self.n_initial_points + 1], model)\n            next_point = all_x[:i + self.n_initial_points + 1][np.argmax(acquisition_values)]\n            next_point = bounds[0] + (bounds[1] - bounds[0]) * next_point\n            all_x[i + self.n_initial_points] = next_point\n            all_y[i + self.n_initial_points] = objective_fn(next_point)\n\n            # Update model\n            model = self._fit_model(all_x[:i + self.n_initial_points + 1], all_y[:i + self.n_initial_points + 1])\n            model_losses[i + 1] = -model.likelihood.log_marginal_probability().item()\n\n        return all_y, all_x, (model_losses, loss_name), self.n_initial_points\n\n```\n\n### /Code",

Your tasks are to analyze the problem, design a feasible algorithm, and implement it using Bayesian Optimization.\n## Task Instruction\nYou need to act as a mathematician, computer scientist, and programmer independently.\n\n**as a mathematician speciliazed in optimization**\n- Identify the key characteristics of the problelms relevant to optimization, such as its multi-modality, separability, and the location of its global minimum.\n- Analyze the problem, focusing on the challenges posed by the problems for optimization algorithms. Consider aspects like local optima, ruggedness, and the search space dimensionality.\n\n**as a computer scientist specialized in bayesian optimization**\n- Based on the problem analysis, propose and compare at least three conceptually different Bayesian Optimization strategies to achieve the best performance on the given problems.\n- You can choose from less complex and more widely applicable approaches(low aggressiveness), or more advanced and specialized techniques(high aggressiveness) tailored to the specific challenges of the problem. Banlance the trade-offs between reward and risk based on AGGRESSIVENESS (0.0-1.0):0.80 \n- Review your choices and design a specific Bayesian Optimization algorithm:\n- Sampling Strategy: Briefly compare popular strategies. Then, explore and justify the selection of a potentially more advanced or specialized sampling technique relevant to the problems' characteristics, such as a quasi-Monte Carlo method with desirable discrepancy properties or a sequential design strategy tailored for exploration.\n- The budget will be provided as a hyperparameter. Choose a strategy to balance n_initial_points and n_iterations. The total number of evaluations should not exceed the budget.\n- Surrogate Model: Briefly compare the standard Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) with common kernels. Then, investigate and justify the choice of a potentially more advanced or specialized surrogate model. Explain the potential advantages of this choice over standard GPR.\n- Choose a metric to evaluate the model, e.g., negative log-likelihood, or other relevant metrics. Justify your choice.\n- Acquisition Function: Briefly compare standard acquisition functions. Then, consider and justify the selection of a potentially more innovative acquisition function designed to handle multi-modality or improve exploration efficiency, such as Thompson Sampling, Information Gain-based approaches, or those incorporating risk or regret considerations. Explain the rationale behind your choice.\n- Choose the promising hyperparameters for the acquisition function, surrogate model, and other components.\n- Other Possible Techniques: Discuss the potential benefits of incorporating cutting-edge techniques within the Bayesian Optimization framework for this specific problem. Explain how these techniques could address the identified challenges.\n- Pseudocode: Write down the detailed steps of your chosen Bayesian Optimization algorithm in plain pseudocode, highlighting any novel components or adaptations.\n\n**as a programmer specialized in python**\n- Name the algorithm using a descriptive name that reflects the chosen components, potentially highlighting the novel aspect of the algorithm.\n- Implement the algorithm in Python strictly following the provided code structure guide. Ensure that the implementation aligns with the pseudocode developed in the previous step, paying particular attention to the implementation of any novel methods.\n- Code Implementation only contain the algorithm class. No usage examples\n- You are allowed to use numpy, scipy, scikit-learn, Gpy, torch, gpytorch and botorch.\n- Use other libraries only if they can not be repalced by the above libraries. \n\n## Problem Description\nthe Beale function\ndimensions:2, Bounds: (array([-4.5, -4.5]), array([4.5, 4.5]))\n## Code Structure Guide\n```python\nfrom typing import Callable\nfrom scipy.stats import qmc # If you are using QMC sampling.

            "description": "#### Problem Analysis\nThe Powell synthetic test function is a multi-dimensional function with a complex landscape, featuring multiple local optima and a global minimum at the origin. The function's characteristics, such as its multi-modality and ruggedness, pose significant challenges for optimization algorithms. The high dimensionality of the search space (6 dimensions) further exacerbates these challenges.\n\n#### Algorithm Design\nTo address the challenges posed by the Powell function, we propose a Bayesian Optimization (BO) algorithm that incorporates advanced techniques to improve exploration efficiency and handle multi-modality. Our algorithm, named `AdvancedBO`, utilizes a quasi-Monte Carlo method for sampling, a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) surrogate model with a Mat\u00e9rn kernel, and an acquisition function based on Thompson Sampling.\n\nThe `AdvancedBO` algorithm balances exploration and exploitation through the use of a quasi-Monte Carlo method, which provides a more efficient and uniform sampling of the search space. The Mat\u00e9rn kernel in the GPR surrogate model allows for a more flexible and accurate representation of the function's landscape. Thompson Sampling, as the acquisition function, enables the algorithm to adaptively balance exploration and exploitation by selecting the next point to evaluate based on the probability of it being the optimal solution.\n\nThe algorithm's parameters, such as the number of initial points and iterations, are chosen to balance the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. The `AdvancedBO` algorithm also incorporates a metric to evaluate the model's performance, such as the negative log-likelihood, to monitor its progress and adjust its parameters as needed.",

The function's characteristics, such as its multi-modality and ruggedness, pose significant challenges for optimization algorithms. The high dimensionality of the search space (6 dimensions) further exacerbates these challenges.\n\n#### Algorithm Design\nTo address the challenges posed by the Powell function, we propose a Bayesian Optimization (BO) algorithm that incorporates advanced techniques to improve exploration efficiency and handle multi-modality. Our algorithm, named `AdvancedBO`, utilizes a quasi-Monte Carlo method for sampling, a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) surrogate model with a Mat\u00e9rn kernel, and an acquisition function based on Thompson Sampling.\n\nThe `AdvancedBO` algorithm balances exploration and exploitation through the use of a quasi-Monte Carlo method, which provides a more efficient and uniform sampling of the search space. The Mat\u00e9rn kernel in the GPR surrogate model allows for a more flexible and accurate representation of the function's landscape. Thompson Sampling, as the acquisition function, enables the algorithm to adaptively balance exploration and exploitation by selecting the next point to evaluate based on the probability of it being the optimal solution.\n\nThe algorithm's parameters, such as the number of initial points and iterations, are chosen to balance the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. The `AdvancedBO` algorithm also incorporates a metric to evaluate the model's performance, such as the negative log-likelihood, to monitor its progress and adjust its parameters as needed.\n\n### /Description\n\n### Code\n```python\nfrom typing import Callable\nfrom scipy.stats import qmc\nimport numpy as np\nfrom botorch.fit import fit_gpytorch_mll\nfrom botorch.models import SingleTaskGP\nfrom botorch.acquisition import UpperConfidenceBound\nfrom botorch.optim import optimize_acqf\nfrom gpytorch.mlls import ExactMarginalLogLikelihood\n\nclass AdvancedBO:\n    def __init__(self):\n        # Initialize optimizer settings\n        self.n_initial_points = 10\n        self.acquisition_function = UpperConfidenceBound\n        self.sampler = qmc.Halton\n\n    def _sample_points(self, n_points, bounds):\n        # sample points using quasi-Monte Carlo method\n        sampler = self.sampler(d=bounds.shape[1], scramble=False)\n        points = sampler.random(n=n_points)\n        points = bounds[0] + (bounds[1] - bounds[0]) * points\n        return points\n\n    def _fit_model(self, X, y):\n        # Fit and tune surrogate model using GPR with Mat\u00e9rn kernel\n        model = SingleTaskGP(train_inputs=X, train_targets=y)\n        mll = ExactMarginalLogLikelihood(model.likelihood, model)\n        fit_gpytorch_mll(mll)\n        return model\n\n    def _acquisition_function(self, model, bounds):\n        # Implement acquisition function using UpperConfidenceBound\n        acq_func = self.acquisition_function(model=model, beta=0.1)\n        return acq_func\n\n    def optimize(self, objective_fn: Callable[[np.ndarray], np.ndarray], bounds: np.ndarray, budget: int) -> tuple[np.ndarray, np.ndarray, tuple[np.ndarray, str], int]:\n        # Main minimize optimization loop\n        n_initial_points = self.n_initial_points\n        n_iterations = budget - n_initial_points\n        all_x = np.zeros((n_initial_points + n_iterations, bounds.shape[1]))\n        all_y = np.zeros((n_initial_points + n_iterations, 1))\n        model_losses = np.zeros(n_initial_points + n_iterations)\n\n        # Evaluate initial points\n        initial_points = self._sample_points(n_initial_points, bounds)\n        all_x[:n_initial_points] = initial_points\n        all_y[:n_initial_points] = objective_fn(initial_points)\n\n        # Fit initial model\n        model = self._fit_model(initial_points, all_y[:n_initial_points])\n        model_losses[0] = -model.likelihood.noise.item()\n\n        # Iterate and optimize\n        for i in range(n_iterations):\n            acq_func = self._acquisition_function(model, bounds)\n            next_point = optimize_acqf(acq_func, bounds=bounds, q=1, num_restarts=10, raw_samples=100)\n            all_x[n_initial_points + i] = next_point\n            all_y[n_initial_points + i] = objective_fn(next_point)\n\n            # Update model\n            model = self._fit_model(all_x[:n_initial_points + i + 1], all_y[:n_initial_points + i + 1])\n            model_losses[i + 1] = -model.likelihood.noise.item()\n\n        return all_y, all_x, (model_losses, \"negative_log_likelihood\"), n_initial_points\n\n```\n\n### /Code",
