The function has a highly irregular landscape with many local minima, making it challenging for optimization algorithms to converge to the global minimum. The function is defined as:\n\nf(x) = -A exp(-B sqrt(1/d sum_{i=1}^d x_i^2)) - exp(1/d sum_{i=1}^d cos(c x_i)) + A + exp(1)\n\nwhere d is the dimensionality of the problem, and A, B, and c are constants. The function is typically evaluated on the domain [-32.768, 32.768]^d.\n\nThe key characteristics of the Ackley test function relevant to optimization are:\n\n* Multi-modality: The function has many local minima, making it challenging for optimization algorithms to converge to the global minimum.\n* Non-convexity: The function is non-convex, meaning that the Hessian matrix is not positive semi-definite, which can lead to convergence issues.\n* High dimensionality: The function is defined in a high-dimensional space (d=6), which can lead to the curse of dimensionality and make optimization more challenging.\n\n### /Problem Analysis\n\n### Potential Techniques\nTo address the challenges of the Ackley test function, several potential techniques can be employed in Bayesian optimization:\n\n* Sampling Strategy: Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods can be used to sample points from the search space, as they have desirable discrepancy properties and can help to cover the search space more evenly.\n* Surrogate Model: A Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model with a Matern kernel can be used as the surrogate model, as it can handle non-convex functions and provide a good trade-off between exploration and exploitation.\n* Acquisition Function: The Expected Improvement (EI) acquisition function can be used to balance exploration and exploitation, as it takes into account both the mean and variance of the predicted function values.\n* Hyperparameters: The hyperparameters of the surrogate model and acquisition function can be tuned using a grid search or random search to find the optimal values.\n* Budget Strategy: A strategy to balance the number of initial points and iterations can be employed, such as using a fixed number of initial points and then allocating the remaining budget to iterations.\n\n### /Potential Techniques\n\n### Proposed Strategies\nBased on the analysis of the problem and the potential techniques, three proposed Bayesian optimization algorithms are:\n\n1. **GPR-EI-BO**: This algorithm uses a GPR model with a Matern kernel as the surrogate model, EI as the acquisition function, and a QMC sampling strategy.\n2. **GPR-TS-BO**: This algorithm uses a GPR model with a Matern kernel as the surrogate model, Thompson Sampling as the acquisition function, and a QMC sampling strategy.\n3. **GPR-PI-BO**: This algorithm uses a GPR model with a Matern kernel as the surrogate model, Probability of Improvement as the acquisition function, and a QMC sampling strategy.\n\n### /Proposed Strategies\n\n### Final Algorithm Design\nThe final algorithm design is **GPR-EI-BO**, which uses a GPR model with a Matern kernel as the surrogate model, EI as the acquisition function, and a QMC sampling strategy. The algorithm is designed to balance exploration and exploitation, and to handle the high dimensionality and multi-modality of the Ackley test function.\n\n### /Final Algorithm Design\n\n### Pseudocode\n```\n1. Initialize the surrogate model and acquisition function\n2. Sample initial points using QMC\n3. Evaluate the objective function at the initial points\n4. Fit the surrogate model to the initial points\n5. For each iteration:\n   a. Compute the acquisition function values for a set of candidate points\n   b.

The function is highly nonlinear and has a large number of local optima, making it challenging for optimization algorithms to converge to the global minimum. The function is also separable, meaning that each variable can be optimized independently. However, the function's ruggedness and high dimensionality (d = 6) make it difficult to explore the entire search space efficiently.\n### Potential Techniques\nTo address the challenges posed by the Ackley test function, several techniques can be employed in a Bayesian Optimization framework:\n- **Sampling Strategy:** Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods can be used to sample points in the search space, as they provide a more uniform coverage of the space compared to random sampling. The Sobol sequence is a popular QMC method that can be used for this purpose.\n- **Surrogate Model:** A Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model with a Mat\u00e9rn kernel can be used as the surrogate model, as it provides a good balance between exploration and exploitation. Alternatively, a more advanced model such as a Deep Gaussian Process (DGP) or a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) can be used to model the complex relationships between the variables.\n- **Acquisition Function:** The Expected Improvement (EI) acquisition function is a popular choice for Bayesian Optimization, as it provides a good balance between exploration and exploitation. However, more innovative acquisition functions such as Thompson Sampling or Information Gain-based approaches can be used to improve the efficiency of the optimization process.\n- **Hyperparameters:** The hyperparameters of the surrogate model and acquisition function need to be carefully tuned to ensure optimal performance.\n### Proposed Strategies\nBased on the analysis of the problem and the potential techniques, three Bayesian Optimization algorithms can be proposed:\n1. **QMC-EI-BO:** This algorithm uses QMC sampling, a GPR model with a Mat\u00e9rn kernel, and the EI acquisition function.\n2. **DGP-TS-BO:** This algorithm uses QMC sampling, a DGP model, and Thompson Sampling as the acquisition function.\n3. **BNN-IG-BO:** This algorithm uses QMC sampling, a BNN model, and an Information Gain-based acquisition function.\n### Final Algorithm Design\nThe **QMC-EI-BO** algorithm is chosen as the final algorithm, with some modifications to improve its performance. The algorithm uses QMC sampling with the Sobol sequence, a GPR model with a Mat\u00e9rn kernel, and the EI acquisition function. The hyperparameters of the surrogate model and acquisition function are tuned using a grid search. The algorithm also uses a budget strategy to balance the number of initial points and iterations.\n### PseudocodeThe pseudocode for the **QMC-EI-BO** algorithm is as follows:\n1. Initialize the QMC sampler and sample the initial points.\n2. Evaluate the objective function at the initial points.\n3. Fit the GPR model to the initial points and evaluate the model's performance.\n4. Iterate until the budget is exhausted:\n   - Sample a new point using the QMC sampler.\n   - Evaluate the objective function at the new point.\n   - Update the GPR model with the new point.\n   - Evaluate the EI acquisition function at the new point.\n   - Select the point with the highest EI value as the next point to evaluate.",

This function has a complex landscape with many local optima, making it challenging for optimization algorithms to find the global minimum. The function is also non-separable, meaning that the optimal value of one variable depends on the values of other variables. The search space dimensionality is 6, which is relatively low, but the bounds are large, making the search space vast.\n\nThe challenges posed by this problem include:\n\n*   Local optima: The function has many local minima, which can trap optimization algorithms and prevent them from finding the global minimum.\n*   Ruggedness: The function has a complex landscape with many peaks and valleys, making it difficult for algorithms to navigate.\n*   Search space dimensionality: Although the dimensionality is relatively low, the large bounds make the search space vast, requiring efficient exploration strategies.\n### Potential Techniques\nTo address the challenges of the Levy synthetic test function, we can consider the following techniques in Bayesian Optimization:\n\n*   **Sampling Strategy:** Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) sampling can be used to efficiently explore the search space. QMC methods have desirable discrepancy properties, which can help to reduce the number of samples required to achieve a certain level of accuracy.\n*   **Surrogate Model:** A Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model with a Matern kernel can be used as the surrogate model. The Matern kernel is a flexible kernel that can capture a wide range of functional relationships, making it suitable for complex functions like the Levy synthetic test function.\n*   **Acquisition Function:** The Expected Improvement (EI) acquisition function can be used to balance exploration and exploitation. However, to handle the multi-modality of the function, we can consider using the Thompson Sampling acquisition function, which is a probabilistic approach that can efficiently explore the search space.\n*   **Hyperparameters:** The hyperparameters of the surrogate model and acquisition function need to be carefully tuned. We can use a grid search or random search to find the optimal hyperparameters.\n*   **Budget Strategy:** To balance the number of initial points and iterations, we can use a strategy that allocates a fixed number of initial points and then iteratively adds new points based on the acquisition function.\n### Proposed Strategies\nBased on the potential techniques, we propose the following three Bayesian Optimization algorithms:\n\n1.  **QMC-EI-BO:** This algorithm uses QMC sampling, a GPR model with a Matern kernel, and the EI acquisition function.\n2.  **QMC-TS-BO:** This algorithm uses QMC sampling, a GPR model with a Matern kernel, and the Thompson Sampling acquisition function.\n3.  **QMC-PI-BO:** This algorithm uses QMC sampling, a GPR model with a Matern kernel, and the Probability of Improvement (PI) acquisition function.\n### Final Algorithm Design\nWe choose to implement the **QMC-TS-BO** algorithm, which uses QMC sampling, a GPR model with a Matern kernel, and the Thompson Sampling acquisition function. This algorithm is designed to efficiently explore the search space and handle the multi-modality of the Levy synthetic test function.\n\nThe aggressiveness of the algorithm is set to 0.8, which means that the algorithm will prioritize exploration over exploitation.\n### PseudocodeThe key steps of the **QMC-TS-BO** algorithm are:\n\n1.

This function has a complex landscape with many local optima, making it challenging for optimization algorithms to find the global minimum. The function is also non-separable, meaning that the optimal value of one variable depends on the values of other variables. The search space dimensionality is 6, which is relatively low, but the bounds are large, making the search space vast.\n\nThe challenges posed by this problem include:\n\n*   Local optima: The function has many local minima, which can trap optimization algorithms and prevent them from finding the global minimum.\n*   Ruggedness: The function has a complex landscape with many peaks and valleys, making it difficult for algorithms to navigate.\n*   Search space dimensionality: Although the dimensionality is relatively low, the large bounds make the search space vast, requiring efficient exploration strategies.\n\n### /Problem Analysis\n\n### Potential Techniques\nTo address the challenges of the Levy synthetic test function, we can consider the following techniques in Bayesian Optimization:\n\n*   **Sampling Strategy:** Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) sampling can be used to efficiently explore the search space. QMC methods have desirable discrepancy properties, which can help to reduce the number of samples required to achieve a certain level of accuracy.\n*   **Surrogate Model:** A Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model with a Matern kernel can be used as the surrogate model. The Matern kernel is a flexible kernel that can capture a wide range of functional relationships, making it suitable for complex functions like the Levy synthetic test function.\n*   **Acquisition Function:** The Expected Improvement (EI) acquisition function can be used to balance exploration and exploitation. However, to handle the multi-modality of the function, we can consider using the Thompson Sampling acquisition function, which is a probabilistic approach that can efficiently explore the search space.\n*   **Hyperparameters:** The hyperparameters of the surrogate model and acquisition function need to be carefully tuned. We can use a grid search or random search to find the optimal hyperparameters.\n*   **Budget Strategy:** To balance the number of initial points and iterations, we can use a strategy that allocates a fixed number of initial points and then iteratively adds new points based on the acquisition function.\n\n### /Potential Techniques\n\n### Proposed Strategies\nBased on the potential techniques, we propose the following three Bayesian Optimization algorithms:\n\n1.  **QMC-EI-BO:** This algorithm uses QMC sampling, a GPR model with a Matern kernel, and the EI acquisition function.\n2.  **QMC-TS-BO:** This algorithm uses QMC sampling, a GPR model with a Matern kernel, and the Thompson Sampling acquisition function.\n3.  **QMC-PI-BO:** This algorithm uses QMC sampling, a GPR model with a Matern kernel, and the Probability of Improvement (PI) acquisition function.\n\n### /Proposed Strategies\n\n### Final Algorithm Design\nWe choose to implement the **QMC-TS-BO** algorithm, which uses QMC sampling, a GPR model with a Matern kernel, and the Thompson Sampling acquisition function. This algorithm is designed to efficiently explore the search space and handle the multi-modality of the Levy synthetic test function.\n\nThe aggressiveness of the algorithm is set to 0.8, which means that the algorithm will prioritize exploration over exploitation.\n\n### /Final Algorithm Design\n\n### Pseudocode\nThe key steps of the **QMC-TS-BO** algorithm are:\n\n1.  Initialize the QMC sampler and the GPR model with a Matern kernel.\n2.  Sample a set of initial points using the QMC sampler.\n3.  Evaluate the objective function at the initial points.\n4.  Fit the GPR model to the evaluated points.\n5.  Iterate until the budget is exhausted:\n    *   Sample a new point using the Thompson Sampling acquisition function.\n    *   Evaluate the objective function at the new point.\n    *   Update the GPR model with the new point.\n6.  Return the best point found and its corresponding objective function value.\n\n### /Pseudocode\n\n### Code\n```python\nfrom typing import Callable\nfrom scipy.stats import qmc\nimport numpy as np\nfrom botorch.models import SingleTaskGP\nfrom botorch.fit import fit_gpytorch_model\nfrom botorch.utils import standardize\nfrom gpytorch.mlls import ExactMarginalLogLikelihood\nimport torch\n\nclass QMCTSBO:\n    def __init__(self):\n        # Initialize optimizer settings\n        self.n_initial_points = 10\n        self.acquisition_function = \"ThompsonSampling\"\n\n    def _sample_points(self, n_points, bounds):\n        # sample points using QMC\n        sampler = qmc.Halton(d=bounds.shape[1], scramble=True)\n        points = sampler.random(n=n_points)\n        points = points * (bounds[1] - bounds[0]) + bounds[0]\n        return points\n\n    def _fit_model(self, X, y):\n        # Fit and tune surrogate model\n        X = standardize(X)\n        model = SingleTaskGP(train_inputs=X, train_targets=y)\n        mll = ExactMarginalLogLikelihood(model.likelihood, model)\n        fit_gpytorch_model(mll)\n        return model\n\n    def _acquisition_function(self, X, model):\n        # Implement Thompson Sampling acquisition function\n        posterior = model.posterior(X)\n        samples = posterior.sample((100,))\n        return torch.mean(samples, dim=0)\n\n    def optimize(self, objective_fn: Callable[[np.ndarray], np.ndarray], bounds: np.ndarray, budget: int) -> tuple[np.ndarray, np.ndarray, tuple[np.ndarray, str], int]:\n        # Main minimize optimization loop\n        self.n_initial_points = min(10, budget)\n        self.n_iterations = budget - self.n_initial_points\n        all_x = np.zeros((budget, bounds.shape[1]))\n        all_y = np.zeros((budget, 1))\n\n        # Initial points\n        x_initial = self._sample_points(self.n_initial_points, bounds)\n        y_initial = objective_fn(x_initial)\n        all_x[:self.n_initial_points] = x_initial\n        all_y[:self.n_initial_points] = y_initial\n\n        model_losses = np.zeros(self.n_iterations + 1)\n        model = self._fit_model(torch.tensor(x_initial), torch.tensor(y_initial))\n        model_losses[0] = -model.log_marginal_likelihood().item()\n\n        for i in range(self.n_iterations):\n            # Sample new point using Thompson Sampling acquisition function\n            x_new = self._sample_points(1, bounds)\n            x_new = torch.tensor(x_new)\n            acq_value = self._acquisition_function(x_new, model)\n            x_new = x_new.numpy()\n\n            # Evaluate objective function at new point\n            y_new = objective_fn(x_new)\n            all_x[self.n_initial_points + i] = x_new\n            all_y[self.n_initial_points + i] = y_new\n\n            # Update model with new point\n            model = self._fit_model(torch.tensor(np.concatenate((all_x[:self.n_initial_points + i + 1],), axis=0)), torch.tensor(np.concatenate((all_y[:self.n_initial_points + i + 1],), axis=0)))\n            model_losses[i + 1] = -model.log_marginal_likelihood().item()\n\n        return all_y, all_x, (model_losses, \"log_marginal_likelihood\"), self.n_initial_points\n\n```\n\n### /Code",

The function has a global minimum at $z = (0, ..., 0)$ with $P(z) = 0$. The function's characteristics include:\n- **Multi-modality**: The function has multiple local minima, making it challenging for optimization algorithms to converge to the global minimum.\n- **Non-separability**: The function is non-separable, meaning that the optimal solution cannot be found by optimizing each variable independently.\n- **Ruggedness**: The function has a rugged landscape, with many local optima and steep slopes, making it difficult for optimization algorithms to navigate.\n- **High-dimensional search space**: The function is defined in a high-dimensional space (6 dimensions), which increases the complexity of the optimization problem.\n### Potential Techniques\nTo address the challenges posed by the Powell synthetic test function, the following Bayesian optimization techniques can be employed:\n- **Sampling Strategy**: Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods, such as the Sobol sequence, can be used to generate a space-filling design of experiments. This can help to efficiently explore the search space and reduce the number of function evaluations required.\n- **Surrogate Model**: Advanced surrogate models, such as Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) with a Mat\u00e9rn kernel or a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN), can be used to model the complex relationships between the input variables and the objective function.\n- **Acquisition Function**: Innovative acquisition functions, such as Thompson Sampling or Information Gain-based approaches, can be used to balance exploration and exploitation and adapt to the changing landscape of the search space.\n- **Hyperparameters**: Hyperparameter tuning can be performed using techniques such as cross-validation or Bayesian optimization to optimize the performance of the surrogate model and acquisition function.\n### Proposed Strategies\nBased on the analysis of the problem and the potential techniques, the following three Bayesian optimization strategies can be proposed:\n1. **QMC-GPR-UCB**: This strategy uses QMC sampling, GPR with a Mat\u00e9rn kernel, and the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) acquisition function.\n2. **Sobol-BNN-TS**: This strategy uses Sobol sampling, a BNN surrogate model, and Thompson Sampling as the acquisition function.\n3. **Latin-Hypercube-GPR-PI**: This strategy uses Latin Hypercube sampling, GPR with a Mat\u00e9rn kernel, and the Probability of Improvement (PI) acquisition function.\n### Final Algorithm Design\nThe final algorithm design is a combination of the proposed strategies, taking into account the characteristics of the problem and the trade-offs between exploration and exploitation.

The chosen algorithm is called **QMC-Matern-GPR-UCB-BO**.\n- **Sampling Strategy**: QMC sampling using the Sobol sequence.\n- **Surrogate Model**: GPR with a Mat\u00e9rn kernel.\n- **Acquisition Function**: UCB acquisition function with a trade-off parameter between exploration and exploitation.\n- **Hyperparameters**: Hyperparameter tuning using cross-validation.\n\n### /Final Algorithm Design\n\n### Pseudocode\n```\nInitialize QMC sampling with Sobol sequence\nInitialize GPR surrogate model with Mat\u00e9rn kernel\nInitialize UCB acquisition function with trade-off parameter\nfor n_initial_points:\n    Sample points using QMC sampling\n    Evaluate objective function at sampled points\n    Fit GPR surrogate model to sampled points\n    Evaluate UCB acquisition function at sampled points\nfor n_iterations:\n    Sample new point using QMC sampling and UCB acquisition function\n    Evaluate objective function at new point\n    Update GPR surrogate model with new point\n    Evaluate UCB acquisition function at new point\nreturn best point and corresponding objective function value\n```\n\n### /Pseudocode\n\n### Code\n```python\nfrom typing import Callable\nfrom scipy.stats import qmc\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.gaussian_process import GaussianProcessRegressor\nfrom sklearn.gaussian_process.kernels import Matern\n\nclass QMC_Matern_GPR_UCB_BO:\n    def __init__(self):\n        # Initialize optimizer settings\n        self.n_initial_points = 10\n        self.trade_off_parameter = 0.1\n        # Configure acquisition function\n        self.acquisition_function = 'UCB'\n\n    def _sample_points(self, n_points):\n        # sample points using QMC sampling\n        sampler = qmc.Sobol(d=6, scramble=True)\n        points = sampler.random(n=n_points)\n        return points\n\n    def _fit_model(self, X, y):\n        # Fit and tune GPR surrogate model\n        kernel = Matern(nu=2.5)\n        gpr = GaussianProcessRegressor(kernel=kernel, alpha=1e-10)\n        gpr.fit(X, y)\n        return gpr\n\n    def _acquisition_function(self, X, gpr):\n        # Implement UCB acquisition function\n        mean, std = gpr.predict(X, return_std=True)\n        ucb = mean + self.trade_off_parameter * std\n        return ucb\n\n    def optimize(self, objective_fn: Callable[[np.ndarray], np.ndarray], bounds: np.ndarray, budget: int) -> tuple[np.ndarray, np.ndarray, tuple[np.ndarray, str], int]:\n        # Main minimize optimization loop\n        self.n_initial_points = int(0.2 * budget)\n        self.n_iterations = budget - self.n_initial_points\n        # Evaluate objective function at initial points\n        X_initial = self._sample_points(self.n_initial_points)\n        X_initial = bounds[0] + X_initial * (bounds[1] - bounds[0])\n        y_initial = objective_fn(X_initial)\n        # Fit GPR surrogate model to initial points\n        gpr = self._fit_model(X_initial, y_initial)\n        # Evaluate UCB acquisition function at initial points\n        ucb_initial = self._acquisition_function(X_initial, gpr)\n        # Initialize best point and corresponding objective function value\n        best_point = X_initial[np.argmin(y_initial)]\n        best_value = np.min(y_initial)\n        # Initialize model losses\n        model_losses = []\n        for i in range(self.n_iterations):\n            # Sample new point using QMC sampling and UCB acquisition function\n            new_point = self._sample_points(1)\n            new_point = bounds[0] + new_point * (bounds[1] - bounds[0])\n            # Evaluate objective function at new point\n            new_value = objective_fn(new_point)\n            # Update GPR surrogate model with new point\n            gpr = self._fit_model(np.vstack((X_initial, new_point)), np.vstack((y_initial, new_value)))\n            # Evaluate UCB acquisition function at new point\n            ucb_new = self._acquisition_function(new_point, gpr)\n            # Update best point and corresponding objective function value\n            if new_value < best_value:\n                best_point = new_point\n                best_value = new_value\n            # Update initial points and values\n            X_initial = np.vstack((X_initial, new_point))\n            y_initial = np.vstack((y_initial, new_value))\n            # Evaluate model loss\n            model_loss = np.mean((gpr.predict(X_initial) - y_initial) ** 2)\n            model_losses.append(model_loss)\n        return y_initial, X_initial, (np.array(model_losses), 'mean_squared_error'), self.n_initial_points\n\n```\n\n### /Code",

The function has multiple local optima, and its global minimum is located in a region with a high density of local optima. This makes the problem challenging for optimization algorithms, as they need to balance exploration and exploitation to avoid getting stuck in local optima.\n\nThe function is defined as:\n\nM(x) = sum_{i=1}^d sin(x_i) (sin(i x_i^2 / pi)^20)\n\nwhere d is the dimensionality of the problem, and x_i is the i-th component of the input vector x.\n\nThe problem has the following characteristics:\n\n* Multi-modality: The function has multiple local optima, making it challenging for optimization algorithms to converge to the global optimum.\n* Non-convexity: The function is non-convex, meaning that the Hessian matrix is not positive semi-definite, which makes it difficult to use gradient-based optimization methods.\n* High dimensionality: The problem has a high dimensionality (d=6), which makes it challenging for optimization algorithms to explore the entire search space.\n### Potential Techniques\nTo address the challenges of the Michalewicz synthetic test function, we can use the following techniques:\n\n* Sampling Strategy: We can use a quasi-Monte Carlo method with desirable discrepancy properties, such as the Sobol sequence or the Halton sequence, to sample points in the search space. This can help to reduce the number of function evaluations required to achieve a given level of accuracy.\n* Surrogate Model: We can use a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model with a Matern kernel to model the objective function. The Matern kernel is a good choice for this problem because it can capture the non-stationarity and anisotropy of the function.\n* Acquisition Function: We can use the Expected Improvement (EI) acquisition function to balance exploration and exploitation. The EI acquisition function is a good choice for this problem because it can handle the multi-modality and non-convexity of the function.\n* Hyperparameters: We can use a grid search or a random search to tune the hyperparameters of the surrogate model and the acquisition function.\n### Proposed Strategies\nBased on the analysis of the problem and the potential techniques, we propose the following three Bayesian Optimization strategies:\n\n1. **Standard BO**: This strategy uses a standard GPR model with a Matern kernel and an EI acquisition function.\n2. **Advanced BO**: This strategy uses a GPR model with a Matern kernel and an EI acquisition function, and also uses a quasi-Monte Carlo method to sample points in the search space.\n3. **Innovative BO**: This strategy uses a GPR model with a Matern kernel and an EI acquisition function, and also uses a trust region method to adapt the acquisition function to the local topology of the objective function.\n### Final Algorithm Design\nWe choose the **Advanced BO** strategy, which uses a GPR model with a Matern kernel and an EI acquisition function, and also uses a quasi-Monte Carlo method to sample points in the search space.\n\nThe algorithm has the following components:\n\n* Sampling Strategy: Quasi-Monte Carlo method with a Sobol sequence\n* Surrogate Model: GPR model with a Matern kernel\n* Acquisition Function: EI acquisition function\n* Hyperparameters: Grid search or random search to tune the hyperparameters of the surrogate model and the acquisition function\n\nThe algorithm has an aggressiveness level of 0.8, which means that it will balance exploration and exploitation to achieve a good trade-off between the two.\n### PseudocodeThe pseudocode for the **Advanced BO** algorithm is as follows:\n```\n1. Initialize the surrogate model and the acquisition function\n2. Sample an initial set of points using the quasi-Monte Carlo method\n3. Evaluate the objective function at the sampled points\n4. Fit the surrogate model to the sampled points and their corresponding objective function values\n5. Compute the acquisition function values for a set of candidate points\n6. Select the point with the highest acquisition function value and evaluate the objective function at that point\n7. Update the surrogate model and the acquisition function using the new point and its corresponding objective function value\n8. Repeat steps 5-7 until the budget is exhausted\n```",

The function has multiple local optima, and its global minimum is located in a region with a high density of local optima. This makes the problem challenging for optimization algorithms, as they need to balance exploration and exploitation to avoid getting stuck in local optima.\n\nThe function is defined as:\n\nM(x) = sum_{i=1}^d sin(x_i) (sin(i x_i^2 / pi)^20)\n\nwhere d is the dimensionality of the problem, and x_i is the i-th component of the input vector x.\n\nThe problem has the following characteristics:\n\n* Multi-modality: The function has multiple local optima, making it challenging for optimization algorithms to converge to the global optimum.\n* Non-convexity: The function is non-convex, meaning that the Hessian matrix is not positive semi-definite, which makes it difficult to use gradient-based optimization methods.\n* High dimensionality: The problem has a high dimensionality (d=6), which makes it challenging for optimization algorithms to explore the entire search space.\n\n### /Problem Analysis\n\n### Potential Techniques\nTo address the challenges of the Michalewicz synthetic test function, we can use the following techniques:\n\n* Sampling Strategy: We can use a quasi-Monte Carlo method with desirable discrepancy properties, such as the Sobol sequence or the Halton sequence, to sample points in the search space. This can help to reduce the number of function evaluations required to achieve a given level of accuracy.\n* Surrogate Model: We can use a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model with a Matern kernel to model the objective function. The Matern kernel is a good choice for this problem because it can capture the non-stationarity and anisotropy of the function.\n* Acquisition Function: We can use the Expected Improvement (EI) acquisition function to balance exploration and exploitation. The EI acquisition function is a good choice for this problem because it can handle the multi-modality and non-convexity of the function.\n* Hyperparameters: We can use a grid search or a random search to tune the hyperparameters of the surrogate model and the acquisition function.\n\n### /Potential Techniques\n\n### Proposed Strategies\nBased on the analysis of the problem and the potential techniques, we propose the following three Bayesian Optimization strategies:\n\n1. **Standard BO**: This strategy uses a standard GPR model with a Matern kernel and an EI acquisition function.\n2. **Advanced BO**: This strategy uses a GPR model with a Matern kernel and an EI acquisition function, and also uses a quasi-Monte Carlo method to sample points in the search space.\n3. **Innovative BO**: This strategy uses a GPR model with a Matern kernel and an EI acquisition function, and also uses a trust region method to adapt the acquisition function to the local topology of the objective function.\n\n### /Proposed Strategies\n\n### Final Algorithm Design\nWe choose the **Advanced BO** strategy, which uses a GPR model with a Matern kernel and an EI acquisition function, and also uses a quasi-Monte Carlo method to sample points in the search space.\n\nThe algorithm has the following components:\n\n* Sampling Strategy: Quasi-Monte Carlo method with a Sobol sequence\n* Surrogate Model: GPR model with a Matern kernel\n* Acquisition Function: EI acquisition function\n* Hyperparameters: Grid search or random search to tune the hyperparameters of the surrogate model and the acquisition function\n\nThe algorithm has an aggressiveness level of 0.8, which means that it will balance exploration and exploitation to achieve a good trade-off between the two.\n\n### /Final Algorithm Design\n\n### Pseudocode\nThe pseudocode for the **Advanced BO** algorithm is as follows:\n```\n1. Initialize the surrogate model and the acquisition function\n2. Sample an initial set of points using the quasi-Monte Carlo method\n3. Evaluate the objective function at the sampled points\n4. Fit the surrogate model to the sampled points and their corresponding objective function values\n5. Compute the acquisition function values for a set of candidate points\n6. Select the point with the highest acquisition function value and evaluate the objective function at that point\n7. Update the surrogate model and the acquisition function using the new point and its corresponding objective function value\n8. Repeat steps 5-7 until the budget is exhausted\n```\n### /Pseudocode\n\n\n### Code\n```python\nfrom typing import Callable\nfrom scipy.stats import qmc\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.gaussian_process import GaussianProcessRegressor\nfrom sklearn.gaussian_process.kernels import Matern\n\nclass AdvancedBO:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.n_initial_points = 10\n        self.kernel = Matern(nu=2.5)\n        self.gpr = GaussianProcessRegressor(kernel=self.kernel, n_restarts_optimizer=10)\n        self.acquisition_function = 'ei'\n\n    def _sample_points(self, n_points):\n        sampler = qmc.Sobol(d=self.d, scramble=True)\n        points = sampler.random(n=n_points)\n        return points\n\n    def _fit_model(self, X, y):\n        self.gpr.fit(X, y)\n\n    def _acquisition_function(self, X):\n        mean, std = self.gpr.predict(X, return_std=True)\n        acquisition_function_values = (mean - self.y_best) / std\n        return acquisition_function_values\n\n    def optimize(self, objective_fn: Callable[[np.ndarray], np.ndarray], bounds: np.ndarray, budget: int) -> tuple[np.ndarray, np.ndarray, tuple[np.ndarray, str], int]:\n        self.d = bounds.shape[1]\n        self.n_iterations = budget - self.n_initial_points\n        self.y_best = np.inf\n        self.model_losses = []\n        self.loss_name = 'negative_log_likelihood'\n\n        X_initial = self._sample_points(self.n_initial_points)\n        y_initial = objective_fn(X_initial)\n        self._fit_model(X_initial, y_initial)\n        self.y_best = np.min(y_initial)\n\n        all_X = X_initial\n        all_y = y_initial\n\n        for _ in range(self.n_iterations):\n            candidate_points = self._sample_points(100)\n            acquisition_function_values = self._acquisition_function(candidate_points)\n            next_point_index = np.argmax(acquisition_function_values)\n            next_point = candidate_points[next_point_index]\n            next_y = objective_fn(next_point)\n            self._fit_model(np.vstack((all_X, next_point)), np.vstack((all_y, next_y)))\n            all_X = np.vstack((all_X, next_point))\n            all_y = np.vstack((all_y, next_y))\n            self.y_best = np.min(all_y)\n            self.model_losses.append(self.gpr.log_marginal_likelihood_value_)\n\n        return all_y, all_X, (np.array(self.model_losses), self.loss_name), self.n_initial_points\n\n```\n### /Code\n\nNote: This implementation assumes that the `objective_fn` function takes a 2D numpy array as input and returns a 2D numpy array as output.

The bounds for the function are (-15, -3) for the first dimension and (-5, 3) for the second dimension. This function is known for its difficulty in optimization due to its multi-modality and ruggedness. The key challenges in optimizing this function include avoiding local optima, handling the high dimensionality of the search space (although it's 2D, the complexity of the landscape makes it challenging), and balancing exploration and exploitation.\n### Potential Techniques\nAs a computer scientist, several Bayesian optimization techniques can be employed to tackle the challenges posed by the Bukin function:\n- **Sampling Strategy**: Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods can be used for their efficiency in covering the search space. Given the complexity of the Bukin function, using a QMC method like Sobol or Halton sequences could provide a good balance between exploration and exploitation.\n- **Surrogate Model**: While Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) with standard kernels (e.g., Matern, RBF) is commonly used, a more advanced or specialized surrogate model such as a Deep Gaussian Process or a Bayesian Neural Network could potentially better capture the complex relationships in the Bukin function.\n- **Metric for Evaluation**: Negative log-likelihood could be a suitable metric for evaluating the model, as it provides a measure of how well the model fits the observed data.\n- **Acquisition Function**: The acquisition function plays a crucial role in balancing exploration and exploitation. Functions like Expected Improvement (EI), Probability of Improvement (PI), or more innovative approaches like Thompson Sampling or Entropy Search could be beneficial. For the Bukin function, an acquisition function that leans towards exploration might be more effective due to its multi-modality.\n- **Hyperparameters**: Choosing the right hyperparameters for the surrogate model and acquisition function is critical. This could involve tuning the kernel parameters of the GPR, the learning rate of a Bayesian Neural Network, or the parameters of the acquisition function.\n- **Budget Strategy**: Given a budget, a strategy to balance the number of initial points and iterations must be devised. A higher number of initial points can provide a better initial model but leaves fewer evaluations for refinement.\n### Proposed Strategies\nBased on the analysis, three potential Bayesian optimization algorithms could be proposed:\n1. **BasicBO**: Utilizes QMC for sampling, GPR with a Matern kernel as the surrogate model, and Expected Improvement as the acquisition function.\n2. **DeepBO**: Employs QMC for sampling, a Deep Gaussian Process as the surrogate model, and Thompson Sampling as the acquisition function.\n3. **InnovativeBO**: Uses a sequential design strategy for sampling, a Bayesian Neural Network as the surrogate model, and an acquisition function based on Entropy Search.\n### Final Algorithm Design\nGiven the aggressiveness level of 0.8, a balance between exploration and exploitation is desired, leaning slightly towards exploration due to the multi-modality of the Bukin function. **InnovativeBO** seems like a promising choice as it incorporates advanced techniques for handling complex landscapes. However, to balance aggressiveness and ensure robustness, we might adjust the acquisition function to incorporate elements of both Thompson Sampling and Entropy Search, focusing on maximizing information gain while exploring new areas of the search space.\n### Pseudocode1. Initialize the Bayesian Optimization algorithm with the specified bounds and budget.\n2. Sample initial points using a sequential design strategy, aiming for a diverse set of points across the search space.\n3. Fit a Bayesian Neural Network as the surrogate model to the initial points.\n4. Evaluate the model using negative log-likelihood as the metric.\n5. Iterate the following steps until the budget is exhausted:\n   - Calculate the acquisition function values for a set of candidate points, using a combination of Thompson Sampling and Entropy Search.\n   - Select the point with the highest acquisition function value.\n   - Evaluate the objective function at the selected point.\n   - Update the surrogate model with the new point and its objective function value.\n6. Return the best found point and its objective function value, along with the model losses at each iteration.",

The bounds for the function are (-15, -3) for the first dimension and (-5, 3) for the second dimension. This function is known for its difficulty in optimization due to its multi-modality and ruggedness. The key challenges in optimizing this function include avoiding local optima, handling the high dimensionality of the search space (although it's 2D, the complexity of the landscape makes it challenging), and balancing exploration and exploitation.\n\n### /Problem Analysis\n\n### Potential Techniques\nAs a computer scientist, several Bayesian optimization techniques can be employed to tackle the challenges posed by the Bukin function:\n- **Sampling Strategy**: Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods can be used for their efficiency in covering the search space. Given the complexity of the Bukin function, using a QMC method like Sobol or Halton sequences could provide a good balance between exploration and exploitation.\n- **Surrogate Model**: While Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) with standard kernels (e.g., Matern, RBF) is commonly used, a more advanced or specialized surrogate model such as a Deep Gaussian Process or a Bayesian Neural Network could potentially better capture the complex relationships in the Bukin function.\n- **Metric for Evaluation**: Negative log-likelihood could be a suitable metric for evaluating the model, as it provides a measure of how well the model fits the observed data.\n- **Acquisition Function**: The acquisition function plays a crucial role in balancing exploration and exploitation. Functions like Expected Improvement (EI), Probability of Improvement (PI), or more innovative approaches like Thompson Sampling or Entropy Search could be beneficial. For the Bukin function, an acquisition function that leans towards exploration might be more effective due to its multi-modality.\n- **Hyperparameters**: Choosing the right hyperparameters for the surrogate model and acquisition function is critical. This could involve tuning the kernel parameters of the GPR, the learning rate of a Bayesian Neural Network, or the parameters of the acquisition function.\n- **Budget Strategy**: Given a budget, a strategy to balance the number of initial points and iterations must be devised. A higher number of initial points can provide a better initial model but leaves fewer evaluations for refinement.\n\n### /Potential Techniques\n\n### Proposed Strategies\nBased on the analysis, three potential Bayesian optimization algorithms could be proposed:\n1. **BasicBO**: Utilizes QMC for sampling, GPR with a Matern kernel as the surrogate model, and Expected Improvement as the acquisition function.\n2. **DeepBO**: Employs QMC for sampling, a Deep Gaussian Process as the surrogate model, and Thompson Sampling as the acquisition function.\n3. **InnovativeBO**: Uses a sequential design strategy for sampling, a Bayesian Neural Network as the surrogate model, and an acquisition function based on Entropy Search.\n\n### /Proposed Strategies\n\n### Final Algorithm Design\nGiven the aggressiveness level of 0.8, a balance between exploration and exploitation is desired, leaning slightly towards exploration due to the multi-modality of the Bukin function. **InnovativeBO** seems like a promising choice as it incorporates advanced techniques for handling complex landscapes. However, to balance aggressiveness and ensure robustness, we might adjust the acquisition function to incorporate elements of both Thompson Sampling and Entropy Search, focusing on maximizing information gain while exploring new areas of the search space.\n\n### /Final Algorithm Design\n\n### Pseudocode\n1.

            "description": "\n### Problem Analysis\nThe Shekel synthetic test function is a 4-dimensional function with a global minimum at `z_1 = (4, 4, 4, 4)` and `f(z_1) = -10.5363`. The function has multiple local optima, making it a challenging problem for optimization algorithms. The function is defined as:\n\n`f(x) = -sum_{i=1}^10 (sum_{j=1}^4 (x_j - A_{ji})^2 + C_i)^{-1}`\n\nThe function has a large search space with bounds `(0, 10)` for each dimension. The global minimum is located at the center of the search space, but the function has many local optima, which can trap optimization algorithms.\n\nThe challenges posed by this problem include:\n\n*   Multiple local optima: The function has many local optima, making it difficult for optimization algorithms to converge to the global minimum.\n*   Ruggedness: The function has a rugged landscape with many peaks and valleys, making it challenging for optimization algorithms to navigate.\n*   High dimensionality: The function is 4-dimensional, which can lead to the curse of dimensionality and make optimization more difficult.\n### Potential Techniques\nTo address the challenges posed by the Shekel synthetic test function, several techniques can be employed:\n\n*   **Sampling Strategy:** Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) sampling can be used to efficiently sample the search space. QMC sampling has desirable discrepancy properties, which can help to reduce the number of samples required to achieve a given level of accuracy.\n*   **Surrogate Model:** A Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model with a Mat\u00e9rn kernel can be used as the surrogate model. The Mat\u00e9rn kernel is a flexible kernel that can capture a wide range of functional relationships. Alternatively, a more advanced surrogate model such as a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) or a Deep Gaussian Process (DGP) can be used to capture more complex relationships.\n*   **Acquisition Function:** The Expected Improvement (EI) acquisition function can be used to balance exploration and exploitation. EI is a popular acquisition function that measures the expected improvement in the objective function value. Alternatively, more advanced acquisition functions such as Thompson Sampling or Information Gain-based approaches can be used to improve exploration efficiency.\n*   **Hyperparameters:** The hyperparameters of the surrogate model and acquisition function can be tuned using a grid search or Bayesian optimization.\n### Proposed Strategies\nBased on the potential techniques, three Bayesian Optimization algorithms can be proposed:\n\n1.  **QMC-EI-BO:** This algorithm uses QMC sampling, a GPR surrogate model with a Mat\u00e9rn kernel, and the EI acquisition function.\n2.  **BNN-TS-BO:** This algorithm uses a BNN surrogate model and Thompson Sampling as the acquisition function.\n3.  **DGP-IG-BO:** This algorithm uses a DGP surrogate model and an Information Gain-based acquisition function.\n### Final Algorithm Design\nThe final algorithm design is based on the QMC-EI-BO algorithm. This algorithm uses QMC sampling to efficiently sample the search space, a GPR surrogate model with a Mat\u00e9rn kernel to capture the underlying relationships, and the EI acquisition function to balance exploration and exploitation.\n\nThe algorithm has an aggressiveness level of 0.8, which means that it will prioritize exploration over exploitation. The budget strategy is to allocate 10% of the budget to the initial points and the remaining 90% to the iterations.\n### PseudocodeThe pseudocode for the QMC-EI-BO algorithm is as follows:\n\n1.  Initialize the QMC sampler and the GPR surrogate model.\n2.  Sample the initial points using QMC sampling.\n3.  Evaluate the objective function at the initial points.\n4.  Fit the GPR surrogate model to the initial points.\n5.  For each iteration:\n    *   Compute the EI acquisition function values at a set of candidate points.\n    *   Select the point with the highest EI value.\n    *   Evaluate the objective function at the selected point.\n    *   Update the GPR surrogate model with the new point.\n6.  Return the best point found and the corresponding objective function value.",

The function is defined as:\n\n`f(x) = -sum_{i=1}^10 (sum_{j=1}^4 (x_j - A_{ji})^2 + C_i)^{-1}`\n\nThe function has a large search space with bounds `(0, 10)` for each dimension. The global minimum is located at the center of the search space, but the function has many local optima, which can trap optimization algorithms.\n\nThe challenges posed by this problem include:\n\n*   Multiple local optima: The function has many local optima, making it difficult for optimization algorithms to converge to the global minimum.\n*   Ruggedness: The function has a rugged landscape with many peaks and valleys, making it challenging for optimization algorithms to navigate.\n*   High dimensionality: The function is 4-dimensional, which can lead to the curse of dimensionality and make optimization more difficult.\n\n### /Problem Analysis\n\n### Potential Techniques\nTo address the challenges posed by the Shekel synthetic test function, several techniques can be employed:\n\n*   **Sampling Strategy:** Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) sampling can be used to efficiently sample the search space. QMC sampling has desirable discrepancy properties, which can help to reduce the number of samples required to achieve a given level of accuracy.\n*   **Surrogate Model:** A Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model with a Mat\u00e9rn kernel can be used as the surrogate model. The Mat\u00e9rn kernel is a flexible kernel that can capture a wide range of functional relationships. Alternatively, a more advanced surrogate model such as a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) or a Deep Gaussian Process (DGP) can be used to capture more complex relationships.\n*   **Acquisition Function:** The Expected Improvement (EI) acquisition function can be used to balance exploration and exploitation. EI is a popular acquisition function that measures the expected improvement in the objective function value. Alternatively, more advanced acquisition functions such as Thompson Sampling or Information Gain-based approaches can be used to improve exploration efficiency.\n*   **Hyperparameters:** The hyperparameters of the surrogate model and acquisition function can be tuned using a grid search or Bayesian optimization.\n\n### /Potential Techniques\n\n### Proposed Strategies\nBased on the potential techniques, three Bayesian Optimization algorithms can be proposed:\n\n1.  **QMC-EI-BO:** This algorithm uses QMC sampling, a GPR surrogate model with a Mat\u00e9rn kernel, and the EI acquisition function.\n2.  **BNN-TS-BO:** This algorithm uses a BNN surrogate model and Thompson Sampling as the acquisition function.\n3.  **DGP-IG-BO:** This algorithm uses a DGP surrogate model and an Information Gain-based acquisition function.\n\n### /Proposed Strategies\n\n### Final Algorithm Design\nThe final algorithm design is based on the QMC-EI-BO algorithm. This algorithm uses QMC sampling to efficiently sample the search space, a GPR surrogate model with a Mat\u00e9rn kernel to capture the underlying relationships, and the EI acquisition function to balance exploration and exploitation.\n\nThe algorithm has an aggressiveness level of 0.8, which means that it will prioritize exploration over exploitation. The budget strategy is to allocate 10% of the budget to the initial points and the remaining 90% to the iterations.\n\n### /Final Algorithm Design\n\n### Pseudocode\nThe pseudocode for the QMC-EI-BO algorithm is as follows:\n\n1.  Initialize the QMC sampler and the GPR surrogate model.\n2.  Sample the initial points using QMC sampling.\n3.  Evaluate the objective function at the initial points.\n4.  Fit the GPR surrogate model to the initial points.\n5.  For each iteration:\n    *   Compute the EI acquisition function values at a set of candidate points.\n    *   Select the point with the highest EI value.\n    *   Evaluate the objective function at the selected point.\n    *   Update the GPR surrogate model with the new point.\n6.

The function has a global minimum at approximately (0, 0) with a value of 0. The bounds of the search space are (-5, -5) and (5, 5). The main challenges posed by this function are its multi-modality and ruggedness, which can lead to local optima and make it difficult for optimization algorithms to converge to the global minimum.\n### Potential Techniques\nSeveral techniques can be employed to address the challenges of the ThreeHumpCamel function:\n- **Sampling Strategy:** Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods can be used to sample points, as they have desirable discrepancy properties and can efficiently explore the search space.\n- **Surrogate Model:** A Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model with a Mat\u00e9rn kernel can be used as the surrogate model, as it is suitable for modeling complex, non-linear relationships.\n- **Acquisition Function:** The Expected Improvement (EI) acquisition function can be used to balance exploration and exploitation, but more innovative approaches such as Thompson Sampling or Information Gain-based methods can also be considered.\n- **Hyperparameters:** The hyperparameters for the acquisition function, surrogate model, and other components need to be carefully chosen to achieve good performance.\n### Proposed Strategies\nBased on the analysis, three potential Bayesian Optimization algorithms can be proposed:\n1. **BasicBO:** A simple algorithm using QMC sampling, GPR with a Mat\u00e9rn kernel, and the EI acquisition function.\n2. **InnovativeBO:** An algorithm using QMC sampling, GPR with a Mat\u00e9rn kernel, and Thompson Sampling as the acquisition function.\n3. **AdvancedBO:** An algorithm using sequential design strategies, a more advanced surrogate model such as a deep Gaussian process, and an Information Gain-based acquisition function.\n### Final Algorithm Design\nThe chosen algorithm is **AdvancedBO**, which uses a sequential design strategy for sampling, a deep Gaussian process as the surrogate model, and an Information Gain-based acquisition function. The aggressiveness of the algorithm is set to 0.8, which means it will balance exploration and exploitation. The budget strategy is to allocate 10 initial points and then perform 90 iterations.\n### Pseudocode1. Initialize the algorithm with the given bounds and budget.\n2. Sample 10 initial points using a sequential design strategy.\n3. Evaluate the objective function at the initial points.\n4. Fit a deep Gaussian process surrogate model to the data.\n5. For 90 iterations:\n   - Compute the Information Gain-based acquisition function.\n   - Select the point with the highest acquisition value.\n   - Evaluate the objective function at the selected point.\n   - Update the surrogate model with the new data point.\n6.

The main challenges posed by this function are its multi-modality and ruggedness, which can lead to local optima and make it difficult for optimization algorithms to converge to the global minimum.\n\n### /Problem Analysis\n\n### Potential Techniques\nSeveral techniques can be employed to address the challenges of the ThreeHumpCamel function:\n- **Sampling Strategy:** Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods can be used to sample points, as they have desirable discrepancy properties and can efficiently explore the search space.\n- **Surrogate Model:** A Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model with a Mat\u00e9rn kernel can be used as the surrogate model, as it is suitable for modeling complex, non-linear relationships.\n- **Acquisition Function:** The Expected Improvement (EI) acquisition function can be used to balance exploration and exploitation, but more innovative approaches such as Thompson Sampling or Information Gain-based methods can also be considered.\n- **Hyperparameters:** The hyperparameters for the acquisition function, surrogate model, and other components need to be carefully chosen to achieve good performance.\n\n### /Potential Techniques\n\n### Proposed Strategies\nBased on the analysis, three potential Bayesian Optimization algorithms can be proposed:\n1. **BasicBO:** A simple algorithm using QMC sampling, GPR with a Mat\u00e9rn kernel, and the EI acquisition function.\n2. **InnovativeBO:** An algorithm using QMC sampling, GPR with a Mat\u00e9rn kernel, and Thompson Sampling as the acquisition function.\n3. **AdvancedBO:** An algorithm using sequential design strategies, a more advanced surrogate model such as a deep Gaussian process, and an Information Gain-based acquisition function.\n\n### /Proposed Strategies\n\n### Final Algorithm Design\nThe chosen algorithm is **AdvancedBO**, which uses a sequential design strategy for sampling, a deep Gaussian process as the surrogate model, and an Information Gain-based acquisition function. The aggressiveness of the algorithm is set to 0.8, which means it will balance exploration and exploitation. The budget strategy is to allocate 10 initial points and then perform 90 iterations.\n\n### /Final Algorithm Design\n\n### Pseudocode\n1. Initialize the algorithm with the given bounds and budget.\n2. Sample 10 initial points using a sequential design strategy.\n3. Evaluate the objective function at the initial points.\n4. Fit a deep Gaussian process surrogate model to the data.\n5. For 90 iterations:\n   - Compute the Information Gain-based acquisition function.\n   - Select the point with the highest acquisition value.\n   - Evaluate the objective function at the selected point.\n   - Update the surrogate model with the new data point.\n6.

The function is also highly non-linear and non-convex, which can make it difficult for algorithms to navigate the search space.\n\nThe key characteristics of the problem relevant to optimization are:\n\n* Multi-modality: The function has multiple local minima, making it challenging for algorithms to converge to the global minimum.\n* Non-linearity: The function is highly non-linear, making it difficult for algorithms to navigate the search space.\n* Non-convexity: The function is non-convex, which can make it difficult for algorithms to converge to the global minimum.\n* High dimensionality: The function is defined in a high-dimensional space (d=6), which can make it difficult for algorithms to search the entire space.\n\n### /Problem Analysis\n\n### Potential Techniques\nTo address the challenges posed by the Ackley test function, several potential techniques can be employed:\n\n* Sampling Strategy: A quasi-Monte Carlo method with desirable discrepancy properties can be used to sample points in the search space. This can help to ensure that the points are evenly distributed and that the algorithm can effectively search the entire space.\n* Surrogate Model: A Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model with a Matern kernel can be used as a surrogate model. This kernel is suitable for non-linear and non-convex functions, and can help to capture the underlying structure of the function.\n* Acquisition Function: A Thompson Sampling-based acquisition function can be used to balance exploration and exploitation. This function is suitable for multi-modal functions and can help to ensure that the algorithm converges to the global minimum.\n* Hyperparameters: The hyperparameters of the surrogate model and acquisition function can be tuned using a Bayesian optimization algorithm.\n\n### /Potential Techniques\n\n### Proposed Strategies\nBased on the potential techniques, three proposed strategies for Bayesian optimization algorithms are:\n\n1. **Quasi-Monte Carlo-based Bayesian Optimization**: This algorithm uses a quasi-Monte Carlo method to sample points in the search space and a GPR model with a Matern kernel as a surrogate model.
