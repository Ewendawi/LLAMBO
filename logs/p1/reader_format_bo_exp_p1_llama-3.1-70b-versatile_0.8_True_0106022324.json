Your tasks are to analyze the problem, design a feasible algorithm, and implement it using Bayesian Optimization.\n## Task Instruction\nYou need to act as a mathematician, computer scientist, and programmer independently.\n\n**as a mathematician speciliazed in optimization**\n- Identify the key characteristics of the problelms relevant to optimization, such as its multi-modality, separability, and the location of its global minimum.\n- Analyze the problem, focusing on the challenges posed by the problems for optimization algorithms. Consider aspects like local optima, ruggedness, and the search space dimensionality.\n\n**as a computer scientist specialized in bayesian optimization**\n- Based on the problem analysis, propose and compare at least three conceptually different Bayesian Optimization strategies to achieve the best performance on the given problems.\n- You can choose from less complex and more widely applicable approaches(low aggressiveness), or more advanced and specialized techniques(high aggressiveness) tailored to the specific challenges of the problem. Banlance the trade-offs between reward and risk based on AGGRESSIVENESS (0.0-1.0):0.80 \n- Review your choices and design a specific Bayesian Optimization algorithm:\n- Sampling Strategy: Briefly compare popular strategies. Then, explore and justify the selection of a potentially more advanced or specialized sampling technique relevant to the problems' characteristics, such as a quasi-Monte Carlo method with desirable discrepancy properties or a sequential design strategy tailored for exploration.\n- The budget will be provided as a hyperparameter. Choose a strategy to balance n_initial_points and n_iterations. The total number of evaluations should not exceed the budget.\n- Surrogate Model: Briefly compare the standard Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) with common kernels. Then, investigate and justify the choice of a potentially more advanced or specialized surrogate model. Explain the potential advantages of this choice over standard GPR.\n- Choose a metric to evaluate the model, e.g., negative log-likelihood, or other relevant metrics. Justify your choice.\n- Acquisition Function: Briefly compare standard acquisition functions. Then, consider and justify the selection of a potentially more innovative acquisition function designed to handle multi-modality or improve exploration efficiency, such as Thompson Sampling, Information Gain-based approaches, or those incorporating risk or regret considerations. Explain the rationale behind your choice.\n- Choose the promising hyperparameters for the acquisition function, surrogate model, and other components.\n- Other Possible Techniques: Discuss the potential benefits of incorporating cutting-edge techniques within the Bayesian Optimization framework for this specific problem. Explain how these techniques could address the identified challenges.\n- Pseudocode: Write down the detailed steps of your chosen Bayesian Optimization algorithm in plain pseudocode, highlighting any novel components or adaptations.\n\n**as a programmer specialized in python**\n- Name the algorithm using a descriptive name that reflects the chosen components, potentially highlighting the novel aspect of the algorithm.\n- Implement the algorithm in Python strictly following the provided code structure guide. Ensure that the implementation aligns with the pseudocode developed in the previous step, paying particular attention to the implementation of any novel methods.\n- Code Implementation only contain the algorithm class. No usage examples\n- You are allowed to use numpy, scipy, scikit-learn, Gpy, torch, gpytorch and botorch.\n- Use other libraries only if they can not be repalced by the above libraries. \n\n## Problem Description\nHolder Table synthetic test function.\n\n    Two-dimensional function (typically evaluated on `[0, 10] x [0, 10]`):\n\n        `H(x) = - | sin(x_1) * cos(x_2) * exp(| 1 - ||x|| / pi | ) |`\n\n    H has 4 global minima with `H(z_i) = -19.2085` at\n\n        z_1 = ( 8.05502,  9.66459)\n        z_2 = (-8.05502, -9.66459)\n        z_3 = (-8.05502,  9.66459)\n        z_4 = ( 8.05502, -9.66459)\n    \ndimensions:2, Bounds: (array([-10., -10.]), array([10., 10.]))\n## Code Structure Guide\n```python\nfrom typing import Callable\nfrom scipy.stats import qmc # If you are using QMC sampling.

The function is multi-modal, meaning that it has multiple local optima, and its global minima are located at the points `z_1 = (8.05502, 9.66459)`, `z_2 = (-8.05502, -9.66459)`, `z_3 = (-8.05502, 9.66459)`, and `z_4 = (8.05502, -9.66459)`. The function is defined as `H(x) = - | sin(x_1) * cos(x_2) * exp(| 1 - ||x|| / pi | ) |`, where `x = (x_1, x_2)`.\n\nThe main challenges posed by this problem are its multi-modality and the presence of local optima, which can trap optimization algorithms. The function's ruggedness and the dimensionality of its search space also add to the complexity of the optimization task.\n\n#### Algorithm Design\nTo address the challenges posed by the Holder Table function, we propose a Bayesian Optimization (BO) algorithm that combines a quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) sampling strategy with a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) surrogate model and a Thompson Sampling acquisition function.\n\nThe QMC sampling strategy is chosen for its ability to efficiently explore the search space and provide a good coverage of the region of interest. The GPR surrogate model is selected for its flexibility and ability to model complex relationships between the input variables and the objective function. The Thompson Sampling acquisition function is used to balance the trade-off between exploration and exploitation, as it provides a good balance between exploring new regions of the search space and exploiting the current knowledge of the objective function.\n\nThe BO algorithm is designed to work as follows:\n\n1. Initialize the QMC sampler and generate an initial set of points.\n2. Evaluate the objective function at the initial points and fit the GPR surrogate model.\n3. Use the Thompson Sampling acquisition function to select the next point to evaluate.\n4. Evaluate the objective function at the selected point and update the GPR surrogate model.\n5. Repeat steps 3-4 until the budget is exhausted.\n\nThe algorithm's aggressiveness is set to 0.8, which means that it will focus on exploring new regions of the search space while still exploiting the current knowledge of the objective function.",

The function is multi-modal, meaning that it has multiple local optima, and its global minima are located at the points `z_1 = (8.05502, 9.66459)`, `z_2 = (-8.05502, -9.66459)`, `z_3 = (-8.05502, 9.66459)`, and `z_4 = (8.05502, -9.66459)`. The function is defined as `H(x) = - | sin(x_1) * cos(x_2) * exp(| 1 - ||x|| / pi | ) |`, where `x = (x_1, x_2)`.\n\nThe main challenges posed by this problem are its multi-modality and the presence of local optima, which can trap optimization algorithms. The function's ruggedness and the dimensionality of its search space also add to the complexity of the optimization task.\n\n#### Algorithm Design\nTo address the challenges posed by the Holder Table function, we propose a Bayesian Optimization (BO) algorithm that combines a quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) sampling strategy with a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) surrogate model and a Thompson Sampling acquisition function.\n\nThe QMC sampling strategy is chosen for its ability to efficiently explore the search space and provide a good coverage of the region of interest. The GPR surrogate model is selected for its flexibility and ability to model complex relationships between the input variables and the objective function. The Thompson Sampling acquisition function is used to balance the trade-off between exploration and exploitation, as it provides a good balance between exploring new regions of the search space and exploiting the current knowledge of the objective function.\n\nThe BO algorithm is designed to work as follows:\n\n1. Initialize the QMC sampler and generate an initial set of points.\n2. Evaluate the objective function at the initial points and fit the GPR surrogate model.\n3. Use the Thompson Sampling acquisition function to select the next point to evaluate.\n4. Evaluate the objective function at the selected point and update the GPR surrogate model.\n5. Repeat steps 3-4 until the budget is exhausted.\n\nThe algorithm's aggressiveness is set to 0.8, which means that it will focus on exploring new regions of the search space while still exploiting the current knowledge of the objective function.\n\n### /Description\n\n### Code\n```python\nfrom typing import Callable\nfrom scipy.stats import qmc\nimport numpy as np\nimport torch\nfrom botorch.acquisition import qUpperConfidenceBound\nfrom botorch.fit import fit_gpytorch_model\nfrom botorch.models import SingleTaskGP\nfrom botorch.optim import optimize_acqf\nfrom gpytorch.mlls import ExactMarginalLogLikelihood\n\nclass QMCTSOBO:\n    def __init__(self):\n        # Initialize optimizer settings\n        self.acq_func = qUpperConfidenceBound\n        self.beta = 0.8\n\n    def _sample_points(self, n_points, bounds):\n        # QMC sampling\n        sampler = qmc.Halton(d=2, scramble=True)\n        points = sampler.random(n=n_points)\n        points = qmc.scale(points, bounds[0], bounds[1])\n        return points\n\n    def _fit_model(self, X, y):\n        # Fit GPR surrogate model\n        model = SingleTaskGP(train_X=X, train_Y=y)\n        mll = ExactMarginalLogLikelihood(model.likelihood, model)\n        fit_gpytorch_model(mll)\n        return model\n\n    def _acquisition_function(self, model, bounds):\n        # Thompson Sampling acquisition function\n        acq_func = self.acq_func(model=model, beta=self.beta)\n        return acq_func\n\n    def optimize(self, objective_fn: Callable[[np.ndarray], np.ndarray], bounds: np.ndarray, budget: int) -> tuple[np.ndarray, np.ndarray, tuple[np.ndarray, str], int]:\n        # Main minimize optimization loop\n        n_initial_points = 10\n        n_iterations = budget - n_initial_points\n        all_x = []\n        all_y = []\n        model_losses = []\n\n        # Initial points\n        x_initial = self._sample_points(n_initial_points, bounds)\n        y_initial = objective_fn(x_initial)\n        all_x.append(x_initial)\n        all_y.append(y_initial)\n\n        # Fit initial model\n        model = self._fit_model(x_initial, y_initial)\n        model_loss = -model.likelihood.log_marginal_probability().item()\n        model_losses.append(model_loss)\n\n        for _ in range(n_iterations):\n            # Acquisition function\n            acq_func = self._acquisition_function(model, bounds)\n\n            # Optimize acquisition function\n            x_next = optimize_acqf(acq_func, bounds=bounds, q=1, num_restarts=10, raw_samples=100)\n            x_next = x_next.detach().numpy()\n\n            # Evaluate objective function\n            y_next = objective_fn(x_next)\n            all_x.append(x_next)\n            all_y.append(y_next)\n\n            # Update model\n            model = self._fit_model(torch.cat((model.train_inputs[0], torch.tensor(x_next))), torch.cat((model.train_targets, torch.tensor(y_next))))\n            model_loss = -model.likelihood.log_marginal_probability().item()\n            model_losses.append(model_loss)\n\n        # Combine all points and values\n        all_x = np.concatenate(all_x)\n        all_y = np.concatenate(all_y)\n\n        return all_y, all_x, (np.array(model_losses), 'Negative Log Likelihood'), n_initial_points\n\n```\n\n### /Code",

The function is highly multi-modal, making it challenging for optimization algorithms to converge to the global minimum. The dimensionality of the problem is 6, and the bounds are (-32.768, 32.768) for each dimension.\n\nThe challenges posed by this problem include:\n\n*   Multi-modality: The function has multiple local minima, making it difficult for algorithms to avoid getting stuck in these local optima.\n*   Ruggedness: The function has a large number of local optima, making it difficult for algorithms to navigate the search space.\n*   High dimensionality: The function has 6 dimensions, making it challenging for algorithms to explore the search space efficiently.\n\n#### Algorithm Design\nTo address the challenges posed by the Ackley test function, we will design a Bayesian Optimization algorithm that incorporates the following components:\n\n*   **Sampling Strategy:** We will use a quasi-Monte Carlo sampling method with a Sobol sequence to generate initial points. This method is well-suited for high-dimensional problems and provides a good balance between exploration and exploitation.\n*   **Surrogate Model:** We will use a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model with a Matern kernel to model the objective function. The Matern kernel is a good choice for this problem because it can capture the complex relationships between the input variables.\n*   **Acquisition Function:** We will use the Expected Improvement (EI) acquisition function to balance exploration and exploitation. The EI acquisition function is a good choice for this problem because it can handle multi-modality and provides a good trade-off between exploration and exploitation.\n*   **Budget Allocation:** We will allocate the budget between the number of initial points and the number of iterations. We will use a strategy that allocates 10% of the budget to the number of initial points and the remaining 90% to the number of iterations.",

The function is highly multi-modal, making it challenging for optimization algorithms to converge to the global minimum. The dimensionality of the problem is 6, and the bounds are (-32.768, 32.768) for each dimension.\n\nThe challenges posed by this problem include:\n\n*   Multi-modality: The function has multiple local minima, making it difficult for algorithms to avoid getting stuck in these local optima.\n*   Ruggedness: The function has a large number of local optima, making it difficult for algorithms to navigate the search space.\n*   High dimensionality: The function has 6 dimensions, making it challenging for algorithms to explore the search space efficiently.\n\n#### Algorithm Design\nTo address the challenges posed by the Ackley test function, we will design a Bayesian Optimization algorithm that incorporates the following components:\n\n*   **Sampling Strategy:** We will use a quasi-Monte Carlo sampling method with a Sobol sequence to generate initial points. This method is well-suited for high-dimensional problems and provides a good balance between exploration and exploitation.\n*   **Surrogate Model:** We will use a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model with a Matern kernel to model the objective function. The Matern kernel is a good choice for this problem because it can capture the complex relationships between the input variables.\n*   **Acquisition Function:** We will use the Expected Improvement (EI) acquisition function to balance exploration and exploitation. The EI acquisition function is a good choice for this problem because it can handle multi-modality and provides a good trade-off between exploration and exploitation.\n*   **Budget Allocation:** We will allocate the budget between the number of initial points and the number of iterations. We will use a strategy that allocates 10% of the budget to the number of initial points and the remaining 90% to the number of iterations.\n\n### /Description\n\n### Code\n```python\nfrom typing import Callable\nfrom scipy.stats import qmc\nimport numpy as np\nfrom botorch.acquisition import ExpectedImprovement\nfrom botorch.models import SingleTaskGP\nfrom botorch.fit import fit_gpytorch_model\nfrom gpytorch.mlls import ExactMarginalLogLikelihood\nimport torch\n\nclass AckleyBO:\n    def __init__(self):\n        # Initialize optimizer settings\n        self.n_initial_points = None\n        self.n_iterations = None\n        self.model = None\n        self.acquisition_function = None\n        self.model_losses = []\n\n    def _sample_points(self, n_points, bounds):\n        # Sample points using quasi-Monte Carlo sampling\n        sampler = qmc.Sobol(d=len(bounds[0]), scramble=True)\n        points = sampler.random(n=n_points)\n        points = qmc.scale(points, bounds[0], bounds[1])\n        return points\n\n    def _fit_model(self, X, y):\n        # Fit and tune surrogate model\n        self.model = SingleTaskGP(torch.tensor(X), torch.tensor(y))\n        mll = ExactMarginalLogLikelihood(self.model.likelihood, self.model)\n        fit_gpytorch_model(mll)\n        return self.model\n\n    def _acquisition_function(self, X):\n        # Implement acquisition function\n        self.acquisition_function = ExpectedImprovement(model=self.model, best_f=self.model.train_targets[0].min().item())\n        return self.acquisition_function(torch.tensor(X))\n\n    def optimize(self, objective_fn: Callable[[np.ndarray], np.ndarray], bounds: np.ndarray, budget: int) -> tuple[np.ndarray, np.ndarray, tuple[np.ndarray, str], int]:\n        # Main minimize optimization loop\n        self.n_initial_points = int(0.1 * budget)\n        self.n_iterations = budget - self.n_initial_points\n        X = self._sample_points(self.n_initial_points, bounds)\n        y = objective_fn(X)\n        self.model = self._fit_model(X, y)\n        self.model_losses.append(-self.model.log_marginal_likelihood().item())\n        for _ in range(self.n_iterations):\n            X_new = self._sample_points(1, bounds)\n            acquisition_values = self._acquisition_function(X_new).item()\n            X_new = X_new[acquisition_values.argmax()]\n            y_new = objective_fn(X_new)\n            X = np.vstack((X, X_new))\n            y = np.vstack((y, y_new))\n            self.model = self._fit_model(X, y)\n            self.model_losses.append(-self.model.log_marginal_likelihood().item())\n        return y, X, (np.array(self.model_losses), 'Negative Log Likelihood'), self.n_initial_points\n\n```\n\n### /Code",

This method has desirable discrepancy properties, which can help explore the search space efficiently.\n- **Surrogate Model**: We will use Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) with a Matern kernel, which is suitable for functions with multiple local optima.\n- **Acquisition Function**: We will use the Expected Improvement (EI) acquisition function, which balances exploration and exploitation.\n- **Budget Allocation**: We will allocate the budget by setting the number of initial points (n_initial_points) and the number of iterations (n_iterations) based on the given budget.\n\n### /Description\n\n### Code\n```python\nfrom typing import Callable\nfrom scipy.stats import qmc\nimport numpy as np\nfrom botorch.acquisition import ExpectedImprovement\nfrom botorch.models import SingleTaskGP\nfrom botorch.fit import fit_gpytorch_model\nfrom gpytorch.mlls import ExactMarginalLogLikelihood\n\nclass MichalewiczBO:\n    def __init__(self):\n        # Initialize optimizer settings\n        self.n_initial_points = None\n        self.n_iterations = None\n        # Configure acquisition function\n        self.acquisition_function = ExpectedImprovement\n\n    def _sample_points(self, n_points, bounds):\n        # sample points using Sobol sequence\n        sampler = qmc.Sobol(d=len(bounds[0]), scramble=True)\n        points = sampler.random(n=n_points)\n        scaled_points = points * (bounds[1] - bounds[0]) + bounds[0]\n        return scaled_points\n\n    def _fit_model(self, X, y):\n        # Fit and tune surrogate model\n        model = SingleTaskGP(train_inputs=X, train_targets=y)\n        mll = ExactMarginalLogLikelihood(model.likelihood, model)\n        fit_gpytorch_model(mll)\n        return model\n\n    def _acquisition_function(self, model, points):\n        # Implement acquisition function\n        acquisition_function = self.acquisition_function(model, best_f=model.train_targets.mean())\n        return acquisition_function\n\n    def optimize(self, objective_fn: Callable[[np.ndarray], np.ndarray], bounds: np.ndarray, budget: int) -> tuple[np.ndarray, np.ndarray, tuple[np.ndarray, str], int]:\n        # Main minimize optimization loop\n        self.n_initial_points = int(budget * 0.2)  # allocate 20% of the budget for initial points\n        self.n_iterations = budget - self.n_initial_points\n        initial_points = self._sample_points(self.n_initial_points, bounds)\n        initial_values = objective_fn(initial_points)\n        all_x = initial_points\n        all_y = initial_values\n        model_losses = []\n        for _ in range(self.n_iterations):\n            model = self._fit_model(all_x, all_y)\n            acquisition_function = self._acquisition_function(model, all_x)\n            next_point = acquisition_function.optimize(bounds, num_restarts=10, raw_samples=100)[0]\n            next_value = objective_fn(next_point)\n            all_x = np.vstack((all_x, next_point))\n            all_y = np.vstack((all_y, next_value))\n            model_loss = -model.log_marginal_likelihood().item()\n            model_losses.append(model_loss)\n        return all_y, all_x, (np.array(model_losses), 'negative_log_likelihood'), self.n_initial_points\n```\n\n### /Code",

It is a d-dimensional function, where d is the number of dimensions, and is typically evaluated on the interval [-5, 10]^d. The function has a single global minimum at the point (1, 1, ..., 1) with a function value of 0.0. However, the function is highly non-convex and has many local minima, making it a challenging optimization problem.\n\nThe key characteristics of the Rosenbrock function that are relevant to optimization are its multi-modality, non-separability, and the location of its global minimum. The function is also highly rugged, with many local optima and a large search space dimensionality. These characteristics make it a challenging problem for optimization algorithms, as they need to balance exploration and exploitation to find the global minimum.\n\n#### Algorithm Design\nTo tackle the Rosenbrock optimization problem, we will design a Bayesian optimization algorithm that uses a combination of advanced techniques to achieve good performance. The algorithm will be called \"RosenbrockBO\".\n\nWe will use a quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) sampling strategy to generate the initial points, as it is a more advanced and specialized sampling technique that can handle high-dimensional search spaces. The QMC method will be used with a Sobol sequence, which is a type of QMC sequence that is known for its good properties in high-dimensional spaces.\n\nFor the surrogate model, we will use a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model with a Matern kernel, which is a more advanced kernel that can handle non-convex functions. The GPR model will be fitted using a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) method, which is a common method for fitting GPR models.\n\nThe acquisition function will be the Expected Improvement (EI) function, which is a popular acquisition function that balances exploration and exploitation. The EI function will be used with a trade-off parameter that controls the balance between exploration and exploitation.\n\nThe algorithm will also use a budget-aware strategy to balance the number of initial points and iterations. The total number of evaluations will not exceed the budget, and the algorithm will use a dynamic allocation of the budget to the initial points and iterations.",

It is a challenging problem due to its rugged landscape, many local optima, and high dimensionality. The function has a global minimum at `z_1 = (1, 1, ..., 1)` with `f(z_i) = 0.0`. The key characteristics of this problem relevant to optimization are its multi-modality, non-separability, and the location of its global minimum.\n\nThe challenges posed by this problem for optimization algorithms include:\n\n*   **Local optima**: The function has many local optima, which can trap optimization algorithms and prevent them from finding the global minimum.\n*   **Ruggedness**: The function's landscape is rugged, with many peaks and valleys, making it difficult for optimization algorithms to navigate.\n*   **High dimensionality**: The function is defined in a high-dimensional space (6 dimensions), which increases the complexity of the optimization problem.\n\n#### Algorithm Design\nTo tackle the Rosenbrock synthetic test function, we propose a Bayesian Optimization (BO) algorithm with the following components:\n\n*   **Sampling Strategy**: We will use a quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) method with a Halton sequence to sample the initial points.

            "description": "#### Problem Analysis\nThe given problem is a minimization optimization problem using the Levy synthetic test function. This function has a global minimum at `z_1 = (1, 1, ..., 1)` with `f(z_1) = 0`. The function is multi-modal, meaning it has multiple local minima, and its search space dimensionality is 6. The bounds for each dimension are `[-10, 10]`. The challenges posed by this problem include the presence of local optima and the ruggedness of the function.\n\n#### Algorithm Design\nTo address these challenges, we will use a Bayesian Optimization (BO) approach. BO is a powerful tool for global optimization problems, especially when the objective function is expensive to evaluate. We will compare three different BO strategies:\n\n1.  **Standard Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) with Expected Improvement (EI) acquisition function**: This is a widely used and well-established approach in BO. However, it may not be the best choice for this problem due to its simplicity and potential to get stuck in local optima.\n2.  **GPR with Thompson Sampling acquisition function**: Thompson Sampling is a more advanced acquisition function that can handle multi-modality and improve exploration efficiency. It is a good choice for this problem, but it may require more computational resources.\n3.  **GPR with Information Gain-based acquisition function**: This approach is more innovative and can handle multi-modality and improve exploration efficiency. However, it may require more computational resources and expertise to implement.\n\nWe will choose the second approach, GPR with Thompson Sampling acquisition function, as it provides a good balance between exploration and exploitation. For the surrogate model, we will use a standard GPR with a Matern kernel, which is a good choice for multi-modal functions. We will use the negative log-likelihood as the metric to evaluate the model.\n\nFor the sampling strategy, we will use a quasi-Monte Carlo method with a Sobol sequence, which has desirable discrepancy properties. We will choose `n_initial_points` as 10 and `n_iterations` as `budget - n_initial_points`. We will use a budget of 100 evaluations.",

                "raw_response": "### Description\n#### Problem Analysis\nThe given problem is a minimization optimization problem using the Levy synthetic test function. This function has a global minimum at `z_1 = (1, 1, ..., 1)` with `f(z_1) = 0`. The function is multi-modal, meaning it has multiple local minima, and its search space dimensionality is 6. The bounds for each dimension are `[-10, 10]`. The challenges posed by this problem include the presence of local optima and the ruggedness of the function.\n\n#### Algorithm Design\nTo address these challenges, we will use a Bayesian Optimization (BO) approach. BO is a powerful tool for global optimization problems, especially when the objective function is expensive to evaluate. We will compare three different BO strategies:\n\n1.  **Standard Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) with Expected Improvement (EI) acquisition function**: This is a widely used and well-established approach in BO. However, it may not be the best choice for this problem due to its simplicity and potential to get stuck in local optima.\n2.  **GPR with Thompson Sampling acquisition function**: Thompson Sampling is a more advanced acquisition function that can handle multi-modality and improve exploration efficiency. It is a good choice for this problem, but it may require more computational resources.\n3.  **GPR with Information Gain-based acquisition function**: This approach is more innovative and can handle multi-modality and improve exploration efficiency. However, it may require more computational resources and expertise to implement.\n\nWe will choose the second approach, GPR with Thompson Sampling acquisition function, as it provides a good balance between exploration and exploitation. For the surrogate model, we will use a standard GPR with a Matern kernel, which is a good choice for multi-modal functions. We will use the negative log-likelihood as the metric to evaluate the model.\n\nFor the sampling strategy, we will use a quasi-Monte Carlo method with a Sobol sequence, which has desirable discrepancy properties. We will choose `n_initial_points` as 10 and `n_iterations` as `budget - n_initial_points`. We will use a budget of 100 evaluations.\n\n### /Description\n\n### Code\n```python\nfrom typing import Callable\nfrom scipy.stats import qmc\nimport numpy as np\nfrom botorch.models import SingleTaskGP\nfrom botorch.acquisition import qThompsonSampling\nfrom botorch.optim import optimize_acqf\nfrom gpytorch.mlls import ExactMarginalLogLikelihood\n\nclass LevyBO:\n    def __init__(self):\n        # Initialize optimizer settings\n        self.n_initial_points = 10\n        self.acq_func = qThompsonSampling\n\n    def _sample_points(self, n_points, bounds):\n        # sample points using Sobol sequence\n        sampler = qmc.Sobol(d=bounds.shape[1], scramble=True)\n        points = sampler.random(n=n_points)\n        points = bounds[0] + (bounds[1] - bounds[0]) * points\n        return points\n\n    def _fit_model(self, X, y):\n        # Fit and tune surrogate model\n        model = SingleTaskGP(train_inputs=X, train_targets=y)\n        mll = ExactMarginalLogLikelihood(model.likelihood, model)\n        return model, mll\n\n    def _acquisition_function(self, model, bounds):\n        # Implement acquisition function\n        acq_func = self.acq_func(model=model, bounds=bounds)\n        return acq_func\n\n    def optimize(self, objective_fn: Callable[[np.ndarray], np.ndarray], bounds: np.ndarray, budget: int) -> tuple[np.ndarray, np.ndarray, tuple[np.ndarray, str], int]:\n        # Main minimize optimization loop\n        self.n_iterations = budget - self.n_initial_points\n        model_losses = np.zeros(self.n_iterations + 1)\n        all_x = np.zeros((budget, bounds.shape[1]))\n        all_y = np.zeros((budget, 1))\n\n        # Initial points\n        x_initial = self._sample_points(self.n_initial_points, bounds)\n        y_initial = objective_fn(x_initial)\n        all_x[:self.n_initial_points] = x_initial\n        all_y[:self.n_initial_points] = y_initial\n\n        model, mll = self._fit_model(x_initial, y_initial)\n        model_losses[0] = -mll(model).item()\n\n        for i in range(self.n_iterations):\n            acq_func = self._acquisition_function(model, bounds)\n            new_x = optimize_acqf(acq_func, bounds=bounds, q=1, num_restarts=10, raw_samples=512)[0]\n            new_y = objective_fn(new_x)\n            all_x[self.n_initial_points + i] = new_x\n            all_y[self.n_initial_points + i] = new_y\n\n            model, mll = self._fit_model(np.vstack((x_initial, new_x)), np.vstack((y_initial, new_y)))\n            model_losses[i + 1] = -mll(model).item()\n\n        return all_y, all_x, (model_losses, \"Negative Log Likelihood\"), self.n_initial_points\n\n```\n\n### /Code",

Our algorithm, named `AdvancedShekelBO`, will employ the following components:\n- **Sampling Strategy**: We will use a quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) method with a Sobol sequence to generate initial points, which provides a good balance between exploration and exploitation.\n- **Surrogate Model**: We will use a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model with a Matern kernel, which is suitable for functions with multiple local optima.\n- **Acquisition Function**: We will use the Expected Improvement (EI) acquisition function, which is a popular choice for BO.

The function has multiple local optima, making it challenging for optimization algorithms. The function's multi-modality, separability, and ruggedness pose significant challenges for optimization algorithms.\n\n#### Algorithm Design\nTo tackle the challenges posed by the Shekel function, we propose a Bayesian Optimization (BO) algorithm that utilizes a combination of advanced techniques. Our algorithm, named `AdvancedShekelBO`, will employ the following components:\n- **Sampling Strategy**: We will use a quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) method with a Sobol sequence to generate initial points, which provides a good balance between exploration and exploitation.\n- **Surrogate Model**: We will use a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model with a Matern kernel, which is suitable for functions with multiple local optima.\n- **Acquisition Function**: We will use the Expected Improvement (EI) acquisition function, which is a popular choice for BO. To handle multi-modality, we will also consider the use of Thompson Sampling.\n- **Budget Allocation**: We will allocate the budget between the number of initial points and the number of iterations. The number of initial points will be set to 10, and the remaining budget will be used for iterations.\n\n### /Description\n\n### Code\n```python\nfrom typing import Callable\nfrom scipy.stats import qmc\nimport numpy as np\nfrom botorch.acquisition import ExpectedImprovement\nfrom botorch.models import SingleTaskGP\nfrom botorch.optim import optimize_acqf\nfrom gpytorch.mlls import ExactMarginalLogLikelihood\n\nclass AdvancedShekelBO:\n    def __init__(self):\n        # Initialize optimizer settings\n        self.n_initial_points = None\n        self.n_iterations = None\n        # Configure acquisition function\n        self.acq_func = ExpectedImprovement\n\n    def _sample_points(self, n_points, bounds):\n        # sample points using QMC\n        sampler = qmc.Sobol(d=bounds.shape[1], scramble=True)\n        points = sampler.random(n=n_points)\n        points = qmc.scale(points, bounds[0], bounds[1])\n        return points\n\n    def _fit_model(self, X, y):\n        # Fit and tune surrogate model\n        model = SingleTaskGP(X, y)\n        mll = ExactMarginalLogLikelihood(model.likelihood, model)\n        return model, mll\n\n    def _acquisition_function(self, model, bounds):\n        # Implement acquisition function\n        acq_func = self.acq_func(model)\n        return acq_func\n\n    def optimize(self, objective_fn: Callable[[np.ndarray], np.ndarray], bounds: np.ndarray, budget: int) -> tuple[np.ndarray, np.ndarray, tuple[np.ndarray, str], int]:\n        # Main minimize optimization loop\n        self.n_initial_points = 10\n        self.n_iterations = budget - self.n_initial_points\n        # Generate initial points\n        X_init = self._sample_points(self.n_initial_points, bounds)\n        # Evaluate initial points\n        y_init = objective_fn(X_init)\n        # Initialize model and acquisition function\n        model, mll = self._fit_model(X_init, y_init)\n        acq_func = self._acquisition_function(model, bounds)\n        # Initialize arrays to store results\n        all_x = X_init\n        all_y = y_init\n        model_losses = []\n        # Optimization loop\n        for _ in range(self.n_iterations):\n            # Optimize acquisition function\n            new_x, _ = optimize_acqf(acq_func, bounds=bounds, q=1, num_restarts=10)\n            # Evaluate new point\n            new_y = objective_fn(new_x)\n            # Update model and acquisition function\n            all_x = np.vstack((all_x, new_x))\n            all_y = np.vstack((all_y, new_y))\n            model, mll = self._fit_model(all_x, all_y)\n            acq_func = self._acquisition_function(model, bounds)\n            # Evaluate model using negative log-likelihood\n            model_loss = -mll(model).item()\n            model_losses.append(model_loss)\n        return all_y, all_x, (np.array(model_losses), 'negative_log_likelihood'), self.n_initial_points\n```\n### /Code",
